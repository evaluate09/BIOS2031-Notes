## Question 1
Many UNSW staff and research students are using invertebrate animals to examine a wide range of conservation related research topics. For ONE of these research topics, answer the following questions:
### Provide the common name and full classification of the animal being used. (5 marks)
Common name: Hard corals
Full classification: Phylum Cnidaria, Class Anthozoa, Subclass Hexacorallia
### What is the aim of the research topic? (5 marks)

Using cryopreserved coral samples including sperm, larvae, adult tissue and potentially coral symbionts to rebuild reefs damaged by bleaching, support reef restoration and aid with coral research. Specifically with bleaching, this research is used as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program, which is a range of intervention methods aimed at mitigating damage that is occurring to the Great Barrier Reef as a result of coral bleaching.
### What are the main findings of the research? (10 marks)
Cryopreservation can be and is currently used for preserving sperm in banks. The technology is fairly developed in its current state and the lab utilises a 3D printed center for the main freezing part of the machine, which is cheaper and more accessible. Preserved coral sperm can assist in reef restoration by facilitating genetic flow between isolated populations to help bolster genetic diversity, which is done by using sperm samples collected years apart from the eggs that are being fertilised. Additionally, cryopreserved sperm is screened previously before storage / usage, so this assisted genetic flow removes the risk of disease transmission that would be inherent in moving colonies. Additionally cryopreserved sperm from endangered coral species can fertilise fresh eggs during spawning and assist those species.

For cryopreserved larvae, the main advantage would be that there’s greater flexibility in using the cryopreserved material, as it is not currently possible to cryopreserve eggs so there is a need to wait for spawning to use cryopreserved sperm. However, cryopreserving larvae introduced multiple challenges as larvae are harder to cryopreserve and coral tissues are chill sensitive. Thus, more advanced technology is needed for this process and it is currently under development to be cheaper and more efficient. The current process involves using a high concentration of cryoprotectants with gold nano particles to vitrify larvae, in which afterwards an infrared laser is used to warm the larvae; with a recovery rate of 50% and larvae can function normally post thaw and take on symbionts.

For coral adult tissues, there is further challenge introduced due to containing symbionts, having a skeleton and containing a lot of water. However, cryopreserving coral samples would have the benefit of being more flexible in its usage, i.e., you do not have to wait for spawning. As such, technologies for vitrification and laser warming are still under development to preserve microfragments of coral. 

While coral symbionts are also still under development, and this group proves to be fairly challenging to cryopreserve due to its tough outer membrane that acts as a barrier to water and cryoprotectant movement. Symbionts are, however, an important target for cryopreservation due to their key role in creating energy for corals. The main benefit of cryopreserving these symbionts would be to prevent the loss of diversity in bleaching events as corals tend to eject their symbionts in periods of high stress, such as during these bleaching events.

As such, this research finds that it is possible to cryopreserve certain stages of corals and utilises this to help restore reefs. 
### Why are the invertebrates used appropriate for addressing those research aims? (10 marks
Corals are essential to the formation of coral reefs and provide habitats to a quarter of all marine fish species, as well as also being a natural storm barrier that protects coast lines from storm damage and being an important source of money and food. Thus, the preservation of corals and their symbionts are important for their survival in this age of global warming causing bleaching events at higher frequencies. By taking corals that are at risk and freezing them for further research and use in coral recruitment or establishment of coral nurseries, the research is able to assist in saving coral reefs by establishing new colonies or supporting existing colonies through these additional coral species. 
## Question 2
### Describe and discuss the basic body plan of a sponge (15 marks)

### Use diagrams to illustrate a sponge’s body plan (5 marks)

### List the defining characteristics of sponges (10 marks)
## Question 3
Diploblastic and triploblastic are terms used in the classification of invertebrates that relate to the body plan.
### What do these terms mean? (10 marks) 
### Contrast the body plan and tissue structure of diploblastic and triploblastic invertebrates, using diagrams and provide examples that you have learned about this term (10 marks) 

###  Compare acoelomate, pseudocoelomate, and coelomate body plans, using diagrams and text. Discuss how these body plans relate to diploblastic and triploblastic tissue layers. (10 marks)

## Question 4
### Name three major adaptations of insects that has contributed to their success (15 marks)

### What are the morphological differences between hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects, and how do these differences relate to lifestyle (15 marks)

## Question 5
An endangered species of marine lobster is threatened by the development of a harbour. 
### How would we determine if the species really is endangered? What limits our knowledge on invertebrate abundance? (10 marks)
- According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened species, a species is endangered, or threatened, if there is adequate data showing that a certain % of population decline has occurred over a specific timeframe, if the species occupies only a certain range or if there is a small population size
- Invertebrate abundance is hard to quantify due to their tendency to disperse as larvae, especially for marine species. Many invertebrates are small and hard to find and there are also an incredible amount of species to be surveyed, with many more yet to be found. 

### Outline the reasoning for conservation of threatened species of crustacea. (20 marks)
- Crustaceans hold significant ecological importance as they form a major part of plankton and are predators for other species - additionally some species of crustaceans create habitats not only for themselves but for others
	- E.g. some species of crabs have a symbiotic relationship with anemone - the loss of such crabs can impact these anemone
- Crustaceans also hold significant economic importance for example with crabs, lobsters, prawns, etc. and the loss of biodiversity in crustacea may mean that other species that are caught in the wild and used for human consumption can be affected due to food chain contributors being lost
## Question 6
Mutualisms and symbioses involving invertebrate animals are commonly found in a wide variety of habitats. Choose one example of a mutualism that involves an invertebrate, and answer the following questions:
### Briefly describe the two animal species involved and where the interaction can be found. (5 marks)
- Pompom crab + sea anemones 
	- Crabs have fairly unarmored chelae and cannot defend itself as well or fight off other crabs as efficiently → employs the sea anemone to help it defend itself as sea anemones have stingers / nematocysts 
- Crab carries sea anemones on its claw, the crab is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands

(you could also do the decorator crabs + sea anemone)

### Discuss the benefits to each species involved in the mutualistic relationship. (10 marks)

can look this up on wikipedia tbh
### What structural or behavioural adaptations are associated with living in this mutualistic relationship. (15 marks)
