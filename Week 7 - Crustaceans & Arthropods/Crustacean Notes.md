### Body Plan
- The crustacean body is divided into <u>head (cephalon)</u> and <u>trunk regions</u>
	![[antennae.png]]
	- Head (cephalon) - cephalic shield or carapace usually present, five pairs of appendages 
		1. <u>antennule</u> (first antenna) 
		2. <u>antenna</u> (second antenna) 
		3. <u>mandibles</u> (act as gnathobasic jaws) 
		4. <u>maxillule</u> (first maxilla) 
		5. <u>maxilla</u> (second maxilla)
	- Trunk
		- Cephalic shield or carapace usually present - exoskeleton grows over the segments so the segments are internal
		- Often divided into <u>thorax</u> and <u>abdomen</u>
		- Limbs on each segment are <u>primitively biramous</u>
		- First 1-3 segments can be fused to head providing additional mouthparts (maxillipeds)
	- Other characteristics
		- First 3 thoracic (thorax) segments can be fused to head (limbs become maxillipeds)
		- Gills are associated with appendages
		- Excretion by antennal or maxillary glands
		- Compound and simple (naupliar) eyes 
### Exoskeleton

- Bivalved carapace encloses entire body
- Look like a ball with an eye

## Feeding
- Almost all feeding strategies represented
- Modifications of jointed limbs and mouthparts reflect diet
### Predators & Scavengers
- Many groups (e.g. crabs, stomatopods)
	- Lobsters can eat sea urchins and need big chelates (last 2 segments form “pincer like structure) to grab and crush prey items
- Capture prey with chelate pereopods
- Grind prey with heavily calcified mandibles and other mouthparts
- Examples 
	- Stomatopods stun prey with enlarged pereopods
		- Use claws thump shells until they break
		- Club like claws to grab prey and stun it
	- Snapping shrimps create ‘shock waves’ with their claws by rapidly closing them to stun their prey + creates noise
		- Creates cavitation bubble 

### Parasites
- Several crustacean groups are parasites of fish, marine mammals or other invertebrates
- Some copepods, amphipods, isopods, barnacles
- Highly modified body forms
- Examples
	- Parasitic isopods known as fish lice
		- Grab onto fish and feed onto their tissues
		- E.g. getting into the mouth of a fish and eating the fish’s mouth
	- Copepods
		- Structures to latch onto moving prey
			![[parasitic copepod.png]]
	- Cyamid amphipods (“whale lice”) are specialist whale parasites
	- Rhizocephalan barnacles are internal parasites of crabs
		![[parasitic branacles.png]]
		- Animal forms a network of branched structure inside crabs
### Suspension Feeders
- Removal of particles from the water column
- Limbs and/or antennae used as filters
- Passive use of currents or creating of feeding currents
- Examples
	- Barnacles
		- Can filter particles as small as 2 micrometres
		- Use cirri to collect those particles - feathery type structure
		![[cirri.png]]
	- Copepods
		- Antennae and mouthparts create feeding currents to increase the likelihood with their prey
		![[copepod feeding.png]]
	- Krill
		![[krill feeding.png]]
	- Mole crabs
		- Bury themselves in the sand and stick out their antennae which collect particles that they then bring to their mouth
			![[mole crab feeding.png]]
	- Ghost shrimps
		- Suspension feed within burrows
		- Pleopods create their own currents in their burrows → water gets sucked down into the burrows
### Deposit Feeders
- Many crabs sift through sediments for organic material - eat mud and filter out organic material
- E.g. many crabs

### Herbivores
- Herbivorous species use grinding mandibles to process algal or plant material (like insects)
- Some crabs, amphipods and isopods
- Intertidal and terrestrial crab are important processors of leaf litter in mangroves and some rainforests
- Examples
	- Some crab climb litter to eat leaves (and leaf litter) and fruit
		- Crabs in burrows eating leaf litter on forest floors
	- Wood-boring isopods (‘gribbles’) damage pier pilings, boats, etc.
		- Use microorganisms to digest cellulose

### Commensals
- Some crustaceans use other animals as habitat
- Examples
	- Hermit crabs living inside corals
	- Shrimps that live inside burrows in sponges (sponge shrimps)
	- Shrimp gains protection by living on a toxic sea urchin
	- Decorator crabs use live algae or other invertebrates as camouflage - protection from predators and not be obvious to prey
		- Symbiosis with anemones - commensal relationship is symbiotis, the anemones benefit by getting leftover food from the crab’s messy eating and the crab benefits by being covered by a stinging organism
		- Hermit crab using anemone as a shell - also symbiotic
	- Pompom crabs
		- Grab 2 anemones and put them on each claw - useful for protection when fighting other crabs and organisms
		- Anemones are alive - when crabs are feeding food particles get washed off for their consumption

## Digestive System
- Arthropod plan of 
	- Foregut (cuticle lined)
	- Midgut (absorptive)
	- Hindgut (cuticle lined)
- Limited to small food particles
- External processing by mouthparts
- Internal grinding mechanisms
- Small crustaceans simple, larger crustaceans more complicated
![[flea digestion.png]]
![[crab digestion.png]]

## Respiration
- Small species have high surface area per volume and can rely on gas exchange across the exoskeleton
- Large species require specialised structures (gill)
![[respiration.png]]
![[more respiration diagrams.png]]
![[respiration currents.png]]
- Some terrestrial crabs have gills, they must keep those gills most (e.g. robber crabs)
- Terrestrial isopods have pseudo-tracheae on pleopods
## Reproduction
- Great diversity of life histories
- Gonads are paired elongate structures in various regions of the trunk
- Gonoducts open on the ventral surface of a trunk segment or membrane between segments
![[crab reproduction.png]]
- Sexes are separate in most crustaceans
- Fertilisation usually involves copulation and is generally internal
	- Males need to approach females for internal fertilisation → causes some interesting mating behaviours
- Sperm are usually non-motile and transferred in a spermatophore
- Examples
	- Male fiddler crabs have one greatly enlarged cheliped and have complex territorial and courtship displays
	- Some ostracods use bioluminescence in courtship displays and defence against predators
	- Barnacles are hermaphrodites
		![[barnacle reproduction.png]]
		- Long penis relative to their body size → called a groping penis
		- Will mate with any individual that’s within penis reach
### Parthenogenesis
- Some Cladocerans and ostracods are parthenogenetic
- Females produce offspring from unfertilised eggs
- Males appear intermittently
### Eusociality
- Sponge shrimps are the only marine organisms known to be eusocial
- Live in colonies with a single fertile female (“queen”) and males that guard the colony
### Eggs
- Eggs are most often brooded by the female until hatching
	- Exceptions: krill and prawns are free-spawning
	- Female crabs brood eggs beneath broader abdomen
	- Cladocerans enclose eggs in moult of carapace
Development
- Development varies among groups
	- Direct development (amphipods, isopods, some ostracods)
		- Direct development = hatch into tiny versions of the adult
	- Various larval stages (most groups)
- <u>Nauplius</u> larva
	- All of Class Branchiopoda
	- Most of Class Maxillopoda
	- Some of Class Malacostraca (krill, dendrobranchiate prawns)
	![[nauplius larvae.png]]
- <u>Zoea</u>
	- Most decapods hatch as zoea - floats around plankton → metamorphosis into <u>megalopa</u> → settles onto sea floor or coral reef to turn into crab
- <u>Phyllosoma</u> larva
	- Spiny lobster (Palinura)
	- Lives in plankton for up to 22 months
	- Very widespread dispersal of larval stages
- Barnacle lifecycle
	- Eggs fertilised → hatch into nauplius stage → metamorphosis into cypris stage (oval shaped) → searches for settlement
		- Senses chemical cues from other adults in the system
		- More likely to settle when it smells those cues
			![[barnacle nauplius.png]]
		- Barnacle settlement involves finding a place in the rock → secrete chemicals that act as cement that glue them to the surface → form a calcareous exoskeleton around that and they’re stuck
		- Choose a place that’s close to adults → reproductive success
## Circulation
- Heart is lacking in some small species (most ostracods, some copepods and many barnacles)
- Most have dorsal heart that opens into haemocoel
- Respiratory pigment is most often haemocyanin in solution (some use haemoglobin)
![[circulation.png]]
## Sensory System & CNS
- Organisation reflects body segmentation
- Paired ventral nerve chords with ganglia in each trunk segment
- Ganglia fused in short-bodied forms
![[crustacean cns.png]]
### Eyes
- Median (naupliar) eyes
	- Present in nauplius larvae
	- Lost in most adult forms
	- Present in adults of Class Maxillipoda
- Paired compound eyes
	- Stalked in many malcostracans
	- Sessile in amphipods and isopods
- Stomatopods
	- 16 different photoreceptors
	- Can see polarised light

## Colonisation
### Of Freshwaters
- Changes to osmoregulation
	- Reduced permeability of body surface
	- Absorption of salt from water
	- Lower osmotic concentration of body fluids
	- <u>Osmoregulation</u>
		- Water and salt regulation carried out by single pair of organs located in antennal or maxillary head segment 
		- Arterial blood is filtered to form urine
			![[osmoregulation.png]]
- Changes to reproduction
	- Benthic forms more abundant
	- Planktonic species limited to standing waters
	- Predominance of direct development
	- Desiccation resistant eggs for species in temporary waters
	- Yabbies have no planktonic larval stages like marine lobsters
### Of Land
- Much more recent than insects and arachnids (20 mya vs 400 mya)
- Isopods most successful (>1000 species)
- Fewer amphipods, crabs, ostracods, copepods and Cladocerans
- Changes to respiration
	- Stiff gills in terrestrial crabs
	- Inner lining of carapace can act as lung
	- Pseudotracheae in isopods
- Changes to osmoregulation
	- Behavioural adaptations to reduce water loss
- Changes to reproduction
	- Isopods and amphipods are direct developing (pre-adapted for land)
	- Terrestrial crabs that are derived from freshwater species have large yolky eggs and direct development
		- Terrestrial crabs that are derived from marine species migrate to the ocean to release zoea larvae, e.g. Red crabs on Christmas island
