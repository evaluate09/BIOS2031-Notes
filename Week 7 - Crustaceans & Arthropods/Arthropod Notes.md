## Classification
- Arthropods are derived from a worm-like ancestor

- Most species-rich phylum, occur in almost all conceivable habitats
### Related Phylums

- Damp habitats
- Both worm-like and arthropod-like features
- Annelid-like features
	- Little head development
	- Musculature
	- Jaw structure
	- “Legs”
- Arthropod-like features
	- Chitinous exoskeleton
	- Well-developed brain
	- Spiracles

#### Phylum Tardigrada - water bears
- Tiny 0.1-0.5mm
- Mosses, soils, aquatic habitats
- Tolerant of extreme conditions
#### Subphylum
- Hexapoda
- Myriapoda
- Chelicerata
- Crustacea
- Trilobitomorpha (extinct) - trilobites

## Characteristics
- Bilaterally symmetrical, coelomate animals
- Distinguished from relatives by:
### Rigid exoskeleton
- Cuticle thickened to form external skeleton
- Fibrils of the polysaccharide chitin in a matrix of protein
- Outer layers hardened by cross-linking of proteins (sclerotisation, tanning)

- Animals need to moult and grow to change their exoskeleton

- Grow new exoskeleton → moulting fluid comes in between → sheds outer layer

### Segmentation
- Segmented externally and internally
- Each segment bears one pair of jointed appendages primitively
- Head and trunk regions primitively
- Further specialisation of body regions through fusion of segments (tagmosis) common

### Jointed Limbs
- Arthropoda = jointed limb
- Moved by extrinsic and intrinsic limb muscles
- Huge diversity of form and function
- Soft tissue + muscles to pivot the joint back and forth
- Walking structures, sensory structures, reproductive structures

- uniramous = 1 branch, biramous = 2 branches
