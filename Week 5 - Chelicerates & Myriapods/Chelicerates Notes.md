## Classification
- Phylum Arthropoda → Subphylum Chelicerata
- Diverged in the Mid-Cambrian (550 mya)
- Evolved from being all marine → Palaeozoic (550-248 mya) massive diversity due to Silurian (414 mya) where sea levels started to lower

### Class Pycnogonida - Sea Spiders
- All marine, most basal class
	- Deep oceans
- Sea spiders , nowhere near related to Aranea (true spiders)
- ~1300 species
![[no opisthosoma.png]]
- Small Opisthosoma, no abdome
- Proboscis used for feeding
- Since they are so skinny, some organs are in their legs (right hand side)
- Breathe via diffusion
#### Feeding
- Carnivorous
![[sea spider chelicerate.png]]
- Chelicerae which look sort of like claws
- Proboscis - needle-like structure, like a straw
- Not hunting for anything, comes across it and eats it
	- Not necessarily harming the animal, e.g. eating a sea 
	- Sucking out internal parts of animals
- Eats the insides of cnidarians e.g. certain corals, sea urchins
#### Reproduction
- External fertilisation - many marine animals do this
- Once eggs are externally fertilised the male carries the eggs around its legs - male takes care of them until the young has hatched
- Overtures = structure where eggs are carried
### Class Xiphosura - Horseshoe Crabs
- 4 living species, mostly marine but do come out on the sand to mate
- Sometimes referred to as living fossils, haven’t changed in over 400 million years
	![[horseshoe crab.png]]
- Pedipalps evolved into walking legs - 5 pairs of walking legs
- After the prosoma they have a tail → used for turning themselves order if they’re on their back
- Breathe through gills
#### Feeding
- Carnivorous
- Tend to eat more crustaceans
- Claw-like structure at the end of its legs - used to manipulate the food to break it down (the crustaceans with hard exoskeletons)
- Crushers - crushing down the food to break up the exoskeleton,
Animal brings the food up to the chelicerate - one of the few chelicerates that can eat solid food
	Horseshoe crabs have a crop and a gizzard (similar to birds) - when they swallow their food its further digested in the crop and gizzard - organ that has teeth like structures to grind down the food
	Important to use their appendages to break down their food
#### Reproduction
- Come out into the sand to lay their eggs
- External fertilisation - female digs down into the sand, male mounts her and he releases her sperm when she releases her eggs
- Sexual size dimorphism - female is significantly larger than the male
- No maternal or paternal care
### Class Eurypterids - Sea Scorpions
- ~250 species, <u>extinct chelicerates</u>
- Exclusively marine - found over 400 million y.a.
- Climate change , lived in coral reefs so they died
### Class Ricinulei - Hooded Tickspider
- ~80 species
- 1cm, small and found in leaf litter / caves → hard to find and study
#### Feeding
- Carnivorous - hunt smaller invertebrates like mites or aphids
- They may not have eyes - they have light sensitive organs instead of eyes, mostly looking at movement of some animals
- More active hunters → going out and looking for food / coming across the food
- Hood → underneath it is their chelicerate → use their pedipalps beside the chelicerate (claw like structure) and bring it up to their mouth where they lift up their hood to ingest food
- Straw like needle (hollow needle) ingest some enzymes that break down the insides of their prey’s organs and suck it up
#### Reproduction
- Large 3rd pairs of legs, muscular at the top (THICC THIGHS)
	- Used to crush other males / hold onto a female while they are mating
	- More than likely carries the spermatophore with the 3rd pair of legs
- In between the prosoma and a opisthosoma of a female - almost like a chastity belt that locks up her organs → female unlocks that chastity belt so the male can insert his spermatophore
	- Spermatophore = encasing of the sperm of the male
- Their offspring start off with 6 pairs of legs and then after a certain moult they get 8 legs
### Class Opiliones - Harvestmen
- Also known as the daddy longlegs
![[harvestmen.png]]
- Prosoma and opisthosoma are fused together , not fully fused
- 4 walking legs and chelicera and pedipalps as normal
- More bulbous than a true spider which has very clear segmentation
- Cellar spider is not a harvestmen - small abdomen, long legs 
- Range of diversity, colours, looks 
- Do not make silk and do not have venom
#### Feeding
- Carnivorous - scavengers, eating things that are already dead and feces sometimes
- Some species do actively hunt, ambush hunt
- Don’t tend to have very good eyesight - second pair of legs/third pair used as a sensory organ with the hair on their legs that sense vibrations
#### Reproduction
- Harvestmen have a penile like organ - more internal like fertilisation / mating
- Female takes care of the eggs
- Males may provide a nuptial gift → used to distract a female during the mating process as some females can be aggressive or prevent sexual cannibalism
- Sperm that has no tail 
### Class Solifugae - Camel Spiders
![[class solifugae.png]]
- ~1075 species, found on the African continent
- Hate the sun, in arid places, find a human shadow for shade → camel spiders follow the shadow so it looks like it’s chasing you but it’s trying to get out of the sun
#### Feeding
- Carnivores - active hunters
- Tend to eat bigger foods, small invertebrates / large invertebrates but can eat invertebrates like lizards and small mammals
- Stalk and chase down their prey → use their chelicerates and pedipalps to take apart their prey → take away wings and legs that have little nutrition / meat
	- End up eating whatever is more edible and has more nutrition , thorax, abdomen
- Chelicerates used for the digestive process similar function to proboscis
#### Reproduction
- Female lifted up her abdomen to show her genitalia → male holds spermatophore with its mouth → male inserts his spermatophore into her
- Female larger than the male
- Risk for the male to get sexually cannabilised, in a vulnerable position whilst mating
- Might caress the female as they are mating
- Females do show tendencies of maternal care → burrow / area to deposit eggs and guard their eggs
	- Female that has laid eggs is not receptive to mating again
### Class Acariformes - mites & Class Parasitiformes - ticks
- Mites and ticks have large diversity, colour, body shapes - not too many fancy colours for ticks
- Mites tend to be microscopic
![[mite.png]]
![[tick.png]]
- Prosoma and Opisthosoma fused together, little segmentation
- What sets mites and ticks apart are their feeding - ticks are almost exclusively parasitic
#### Tick Feeding
- Strictly parasitic - blood meals
- Ticks find us by detecting our carbon dioxide (similar to how mosquitoes find us)
- Hang out on long grass , branches of trees waiting for an animal to pass by and stick onto
- Typically find an area on the moister and darker end, e.g. underneath the breast, armpits, hair, in between joints
![[tick mouth.png]]
- Tick uses its pedipalps to open up and show the chelicerate → chelicerate open up and act as anchors 
	- Barbs on the back of the chelicerate
	- Hippos Dome - hollow straw that’s hidden by the chelicerate and it starts sucking the blood up like a straw
		- Backwash from the bloodmeal - their saliva can have pathogens 
	![[tickborne diseases.png]]
	- Alpha Gal makes you allergic to red meat
#### Tick Mating
- Female puts out pheromones so the male can find her, generally after having a blood meal 
- Male transfers spermatophore with their chelicerae or pedipalps, carry it and inseminate the female → female lays eggs
- No maternal or paternal care
- Ticks can parthenogenically reproduce - females do not need a male to fertilise the eggs → unfertilised eggs that hatch as embryos 
#### Mite Reproduction
- Herbivorous, carnivorous and some are parasitic but not necessarily for blood
	- Some parasitic mites eat dead skin cells, lymph
	- Can end up hunting other parasitic mites
- Mites form microhabitats - can have multiple species of mites on your body
	- Mites that strictly live on the beaks of hummingbirds, live in the trachea of bees, specialised mites that live in our eyelashes and eyebrows 
	- Dust mites can cause allergies 
#### Mite Reproduction
- Mate by copulation, male mounts female and transfers sperm to internally fertilise the female → lay the eggs
- Some males leave a spermatophore for a female to come across
- Males may prefer females that are newly malted → newly malted female is a virgin female
	- Sperm competition , be the first one to inseminate her because that could increase his changes of being the offspring
	- Stalking her and waiting for her to moult
- No maternal / paternal care

Bulb mites are called fighter males → third pair of legs evolved into swords, find other males mating with females they end up killing the male with the third pair of legs
### Class Pseudoscorpions - False Scorpions
- ~3000 species
- Look like scorpions but are missing a stinger tail
- Dark dry space, find them in library books; more so in Europe
	- Usually found in leaf litters, in between barks of trees
- About ~1cm 
![[pseudoscorption.png]]
- Pedipalps have evolved into <u>chelate</u> (claws)
- Opisthosoma and Prosoma are not fully fused
![[pseudoscorpion diversity.png]]
#### Feeding
- Carnivores - ambush predators
- Prey up to 8 times their body size 
- Pseudoscorpions work together to catch big prey - animal walks by and they catch the prey
- Communal species tend to be a matriarchy → females do hunting, females take care of the babies
	- Males sometimes get kicked out of the communities because they’re only needed for their sperm
	- When they catch really big prey, they bring the prey in and have a hierarchy when it comes to eating
	- More mature females that are ready to mate will eat first, then their babies, then other females helping out in the community, and lastly the males
#### Reproduction
- Males cling onto a flying insect to disperse to find females not as closely related to them
- Males might do different behaviours, show off their pedipalps to the female, do a tango with the female - grab her by her pedipalps
	- Fertilisation via pedipalps , chelicerates?
	- Males leave a spermatophore in a different place → they’ll end up showing the female where the spermatophore is 
- Maternal care, females carry the eggs
	- In communal pseudoscorpions - communal maternal care
	- Solitary species - they carry their young 
	- Extreme maternal care → matro fagi = eating of the mother
		- Actively hunting to feed the babies, if she is unable to find the prey or if food is scarce then she offers her body to her children
### Class Scorpiones - scorpiones
- ~1200 species
- Common characteristics:
	- Have a stinger tail
	- Glows under UV light - <u>biofluorescence</u> = take the UV light and transmit it in a different wave form - does not create the light itself
		- NOT bioluminescence = enzymes in the animal that emanate the light
- Do like moisture
- All chelicerate moult and you need a moist environment to moult
![[scorpion.png]]
- Opisthosoma has a tail
#### Feeding
- Carnivorous - larger invertebrates, vertebrates (mammals)
- Ambush predators or active hunters, eat things they can catch with their claws
#### Reproduction
- Similar to pseudoscorpions
- Male finds female → does a ritual like a dance → male grabs the female with a tango and brings the female to his spermatophore
- Females carry their young and show extreme case of maternal care, hunt with the young on the and feed the young → if they can’t find good prey then they’ll offer themselves to their young
- Give live birth
	- No embryos or uterus
	- Ovoviviparous →> have eggs that are like chicken eggs inside their bodies → eggs hatch within their mother and then the mother looks like they’re giving live birth → hatched eggs come out of the body
### Class Uropygi - whip scorpion
![[whip scorpion.png]]
- Sometimes called vinegar rooms - spit out acetic acid which smells like acid when threatened
- ~100 species
#### Feeding
- Carnivorous - ambush predator
- Scavenge the grounds to see what prey they can find, may be some active predation
- Spray acetic acid but that is mostly for defense rather than for catching prey
- Front pedipalps to catch preys, perhaps similar hunting to pseudoscorpions
#### Reproduction
- Males do have a spermatophore
- Not much is known about these species
- Female carries the eggs and some maternal care
### Class Amblypygi - Tailless Whip Scorpion
- Second pair of legs act like an antennae because their eye sight is not very good
- They tend to return the same spot, their home - they know where they live and their antennae help them with that
#### Feeding
- Carnivore - eat small invertebrates
- More ambush predators because they can’t see very well
- 2nd pair of antennae like eggs to catch their prey, wait for vibrations to come through and catch their prey that way
#### Mating
- External fertilisation, male leaves its spermatophore and female uses it to fertilise its eggs

### Class Araneae - Spiders
- > 36000 species
![[morphs in spiders.png]]
#### Mygalomorph
- Primitive spiders, tend to be more ground dwelling spiders
	- Less evolved features 
	- Don’t build webs
	- Tend to be very large
	-  Have more potent venom
	- Fangs are more parallel to their body and go down, their fangs open up - raises fangs up when threatened
	- Burrow
	- E.g. tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, Sydney funnel web spiders
	- Two sets of book lungs
##### Feeding
- Mostly carnivores / predators - but there are 2 species of herbivorous spiders
	- Herbivorous spiders eat the plant material
- Fangs that face downwards and must be lifted up
- Live in burrows, found on the ground, ambush predators
	- Wait in burrow to ambush
- Silk burrows → trigger lines made of silk that the prey comes across → triggers spider’s senses
#### Araneomorph
- Silk is common across Aranea but is used for different purposes
- Open side to side
- Sometimes take the stance of a mygalomorph, going on their back and standing up tall
- One set of book lungs
![[diagram spider.png]]
- High diversity, tend to be terrestrial. mimicry with colours
- Walk, build webs, weaves, burrowing spiders, jumping spiders,
##### Feeding
- Predators - active hunters, chase down prey
- Excellent eyesight
- Wolf spiders - night hunters
	- Like cat eyes, eyes glowing in the dark
- Jumping spiders - day hunters
- Crab spiders
	- More of an ambush spiders, wait for an animal to come to a flower and wait for a pollinator, change their colour to match their flower
	- Pollinators are attracted to contrast - spiders exploit this innate behaviour of pollinators, thus they’d catch more prey with the LHS image than the RHS
		![[contrast spider.png]]
	- Camouflage to avoid predation
- Water spiders
	- Can scuba dive with a big bubble and dive down to the bottom - hunt for small fish or marine invertebrates
	- Ambush predator side
- Orb weavers
	- Build different kinds of webs - through evolution they change the way their web shape
	- Silk used to catch prey
	- Spinnerets at the bottom of their abdomen, little needles upon needles upon needles → kind of like a sewing machine used to sew together silk
	- Silk is tough because it accompanies the inertia of an object → can elongate when a prey is caught and come back without breaking shape
	- Orb weaver injects its prey with venom and wrap it up with sillk
	- Spiders can eat their silk, rebuild their webs daily, eating parts of their webs that have broken down
	- Each line has a function in a web
		- Anchor lines, lines where mates know to come across, lines just for prey
		![[feeding drugs to spiders for web shapes.png]]
		- Fed drugs to spiders to see how they build their webs
- Spitting spiders
	- Spiders spit their web out to catch prey and come up to eat the animal
- Pirate spiders
	- Each string of the web has a function → climb up onto a web that string the web as if they are prey → trigger the spider that built the web → pirate spider ambushes the spider that comes to check it out
- Ogre-faced spiders / net casters
	- Sit in between leaves and build a net, wait for prey to walk underneath them and then they grab prey with the net
- Bolus spiders
	- Ball of silk infused with moth pheromones, swings its bolus pretending its a female moth so male moth comes over, smells pheromones and gets caught
	- Typically hunt at night
	- Eyesight is excellent
#### Reproduction
- Jumping spiders - males have colourful abdomens and dance for the females
	- Also get sexually cannabilised
- Orb weavers
	- Strum the female’s web like a guitar, male knows which strings to pull to entice a female
	- Females are huge compared to males → males are very susceptible to sexual cannibalism
	- Not many species of spiders have sexual cannibalism 
		- Male spiders will have certain behaviours or certain structures to avoid being eaten
		- E.g. male has spring like legs after mating to get away from the female’s jaws
		- Used the third pair of jaws to hold the female’s fangs open while mating and then get away as fast as possible
- Wolf spiders drum the ground, caressing the female to calm her down , to be more receptive / calm her down and prevent cannibalism 
- Males have sperm packets in their pedipalps, bulbous pedipalps 
	![[female male spider pedipalps.png]]
	- Female in the middle where the pedipalps are skinny versus the males on the sides 
- Once mating occurs there is a bit of maternal care, some species have paternal care
	- E.g. wolf spiders that carry the young once they hatch
	- E.g. orb weavers → females come over and tend to their egg sac, make sure its getting sun on all parts, all the babies are warm, put more silk and protect them
	- e.g. spiders that carry around their egg sac → spiders that carry their young tend to be more aggressive
	- e.g. jumping spiders that leave their egg sacs under leaves and guarding them to protect them once the eggs hatch and then leave them be
- Many males die after the mating process because they live shorter lives (due to cannibalism) - maybe that’s why there’s little paternal care
## Characteristics
- Arthropod shared characteristics
	- Segmentation - attached by a tissue
	- Bilateral symmetry
	- Exoskeleton made of Chitin
	- Joint appendages - specific sections to a limb
- Chelicerates characteristics
	- No antenna
	- No mandibles - jaws at the front of their head, biting, passing, chewing foods
	- Presence of chelicerae 
		- Chelicerae are at the front, pedipalps come second
		- Can be fangs, pincers or claws - used to catch prey and bring prey into their mouth depending on their feeding method
		- Used for hunting
	- 2 body segments
		- Prosoma = Head and thorax fused / cephalothorax
		- Opisthosoma = abdomen
	- 6 pairs of limbs - 4 are walking limbs 
		- Chelicerae and pedipalps are referred to as limbs
## Chelicerates & Humans
- Spiders are NOT poisonous
	- Poison = ingesting something, breathing it in / eat it
- Spiders are venomous 
	- Venomous = injecting it 
	- All spiders are venomous but 2 species that do not have
	- Venom is not necessarily specific to humans, most spiders are not potent to humans
	- Sydney funnel webs are strictly only potent to primates
	- Some spiders have fangs sharp enough to pierce the skin however most spiders do not have that capacity
- Brown recluse spiders - necrotic venom - causing necrosis of the skin when biting
	- Only found in North America (US) - typically found in Texas
	- 88% of the pictures they got were just regular spiders done by a study on Twitter
- Reasons for fearing spiders: legginess , sudden movement, speediness, hairiness, crawliness, size, skin contact
	- Chelicerate that we did most likely interact with were scorpions - more harmful than spiders (some but not all)
	- Also scary movies to do with spiders
- Ticks exclusively parasitic and carry diseases
- Chelicerates sometimes used as biological control - symbiotic relationships
	- E.g. pseudoscorpions were used in Ancient Egypt to get rid of parasitic animals in beehives, like mites or other parasites
	- Birds also used pseudoscorpions in their nest to get rid of parasites
	- Horseshoe crab blood is blue so used 
- Venom of spiders can be used to create medicine + antivenom
- Spiders can also be used as bioindicators
