- # Classification & Relatives
<u>Phylum Arthropoda → Subphylum Hexapoda → Class Entognatha/ Class Insecta </u>
## Class Entognatha
- 3 orders: Collembola (springtails), Protura (coneheads), Diplura (diplurans)
	- Soft-bodied, wingless
	- Mostly found in moist environments in soil and litter or decomposing organic matter (e.g. rotting logs)
	- Proturans and diplurans are eyeless
- Most primitive class
- Defined by the mouthparts, entognathous (referring to the enclosure of the mandibles and maxillae), which are only everted during feeding
- Collembola and Protura sometimes referred to as the Elliplura and are regarded as being most closely related to Entognatha
- The third Entognatha order, Diplura, are considered to be more distantly related, and having independently derived enclosed mouthparts
- Relationships of these orders are in debate
## Class Insecta
- Comprised of 30 orders
- Most primitive living orders are the bristletails & silverfish - ametabolous insect development and are flightless
- Meoptera are defined primarily by wing folding but is strong supported by DNA characters - includes most of the endopterygote orders and all the holometabolous insects
### <u>Polyneoptera</u> (Exopterygote) - 11 orders
- <u>Orthopteroid orders</u> - grasshoppers, earwigs, stoneflies, footspinners, praying mantids, termites, roaches
- Still contentious and ill-defined; expansion of the anal region of the hind wing
![Enlarged Anal Lobe in Hindwing](enlarged-anal-lobe-hindwing.png)
### <u>Paraneoptera</u> (Exopterygote) - 4 orders
- Hemipteroid orders - book lice, lice, thrips and bugs
- Labial palps reduced/absent, mandibles asymmetrical, maxillary laciniae elongated, abdominal ganglia fused
### Holometabola (Endopterygota) - 11 orders
- Beetles, flies, moths and butterflies, ants and wasps, lacewings, fleas, caddisflies, snakeflies
- Defined by the endopterygote larvae, radical differentiation of larvae and adults, pupal resting phase
- 85% of insect species richness
## Closest relatives:
- Phylum Tardigrada - water bears
	- Four pairs of non-jointed legs
	- Aquatic/semi-aquatic
	- Herbivorous on mosses & lichens
	- About 1000 species
	- Cosmopolitan - common to the whole world
- Phylum Onycophora - velvet worms
	- Trunk-like body
	- Multiple non-jointed legs
	- Moist forests of tropical regions and wet forests of temperate Australia
	- Oldest fossils go back to early Cambrian ~500 million y.a. where marine velvet worms were prominent in the ancient seas
	- Carnivores
		- Capture their prey by spraying them with adhesive secretions

# Characteristics
## Phylum Arthropoda
* Rigid exoskeleton, jointed limbs
* Undergo growth & development through molting of the exoskeleton through a series of immature stages
* The arthropod exoskeleton is rigid and comprised of chitin
* Jointed limbs
* Highly segmented body, repetitive trunk
## Subphylum Hexapoda
- Body divided into head, thorax and abdomen - no other arthropod has this body plan
- 1 pair of antennae
- 3 pairs of mouthparts
- 3 pairs of uniramous (each leg is a single branch) limbs
- Tracheal system of respiration
	- Similar system exists in myriapods (centipedes, millipedes)
## Class Entognatha
* Comprises of three orders, springtails and their relatives

## Class Insecta
- ~30 orders, with 1 or 2 extra/removed orders depending on classification

# Structure & Physiology
- <u>Homology</u> = components of morphology are similar and have an evolutionary basis to this similarity 
## Body Plan
- <u>Somites</u> = insects have ~20 original segments
### Tagmosis
- <u>Tagma</u> = compound body section of an arthropod, e.g. head, thorax, abdomen
- <u>Tagmosis</u> = insects have undergone significant joining and/or coordination of somites to undertake similar functions, also referred to the specialisation of somites
	- Tagmosis resulted in the body insects being organised into a head, thorax and abdomen
		- Head = 6 segments
		- Thorax = 3 segments
		- Abdomen = 11 segments
	- Tagmosis has given them a competitive advantage and is central to their successful diversification and occupation of most habitats on the planet
	- Development of tagma may be correlated to <u>Hox genes</u> which control segmental patterning during development

![[Insect Tagmosis.png]]

## External Anatomy
### Head
- Concerned with feeding, sensory perception
![[Insect Head.png]]
#### Mouthparts
###### Main Mouthparts
- <u>Labrum</u> = top lip, forms the top roof of the mouth cavity
- <u>Mandibles</u> = ventral to the labrum, in most hexapods has 2 points of articulation with the head and have a number of molars and incisors related to biting/chewing functions
- <u>Maxillae</u> = come in pairs, ventral to the mandibles which assist the mandibles in the manipulation of food. Subdivided further into:
	- Basal <u>cardo</u> and <u>stipes</u>
	- Distal <u>laciniae</u> which holds and macerates food
	- Lateral <u>galea</u> and <u>maxillary palps</u> which have sensory hairs that taste the food
- <u>Labium</u> = most ventral mouthpart component, floor of the mouth. Subdivided with:
	- Distal limb-like components including the <u>labial palps</u> which also have a sensory function
##### Feeding Types
- <u>Predators</u> - most feed on other invertebrates but some feed on vertebrates
- <u>Herbivores/phytophagous</u> - feed on vegetative and reproductive parts of the plants, some insects specialise on seeds which are packed with nutrients, also feed on non-flowering plants (e.g. algae, lichens, gymnosperms, ferns)
- <u>Omnivores/zoophytophagous</u> - feed on both living plant and animal material, also referred to as mixed feeders. Certain species can develop successfully on plant/animal food alone but others develop best on a mixture of both
- <u>Detritivores/saprophagous/necrophagous</u> - Feed on the corpses of other animals or decomposing organic matter, e.g. dung beetles feeding on the faeces of vertebrates
- <u>Parasites (ectoparasites and endoparasites)</u> 
	- Ectoparasites = existing outside the organism, endoparasites = existing inside the organism
	- <u>Hyperparasitism</u> = parasites of parasites, e.g. wasps can parasitise other wasps that parasitise other invertebrates
##### Feeding Modes
![[Insect mouthparts.png]]
###### Biting/chewing
![[Biting chewing mouth parts.png]]
- Also called <u>mandibulate</u> mouthparts
- Predators, herbivores, scavengers, parasites can have biting/chewing mouthparts
- Handle and chew solid food
	- Consumption of plant tissue, includes orders such as:
		- Grasshoppers (Orthoptera)
			- E.g. grasshoppers and weevils feeding on food crops
		- Moth & butterfly larvae (Lepidoptera)
		- Beetles (Coleoptera)
			- E.g. feeding on leaves
	- Consumption of animal tissue, includes orders such as:
		- Mantids (Mantodea)
		- Beetles (Coleoptera)
		- Ants & wasps (Hymenoptera)
			- E.g. vespid wasps with vice-like grips of the mandibles
			- E.g. ant lion with massive biting mandibles, ant lion larvae form and hide at the bottom of pit traps which capture passing invertebrate prey 
	- Consumption of dead organic matter
		- Decomposition of plant and animal tissues
		- E.g. dung beetles
	- Consuming wood
		- E.g. termites eating wood which contains cellulose in the cell wall - termites have endosymbionts in their gut to help them digest wood
		- Many beetles and some moth larvae also feed on wood
###### Piercing/sucking

- Mouthparts modified to consume liquid food
- Includes predators, parasites, herbivores
- The feeding method has evolved independently many times among the insects
- Different arrangements of mouthparts involved
- Order of insects includes:
	- Thrips (Thysanoptera)
	- True bugs (Hemiptera)
		![[Piercing mouthparts.png]]
		- In bugs, the mandible and maxillae are elongated into <u>stylets</u>, which are interlocked into a food canal 
			- Through capillary action, fluid transfers from the food source → oral cavity
		- Most true bugs consume plant fluids to target xylem and phloem vessels
			- E.g. scale insects are farmed by ants which keep the scale insects safe and in exchange the ants receive honeydew from the scale insects
	- Some flies (Diptera)
		![[Mosquito mouthparts.png]]
		- In mosquitoes, all mouthparts are elongated but the main component is the labium; unlike the bugs it does not house the elongated maxillae and mandibles
			- Consume animal fluids, vectors for many diseases including malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, etc.
	- Fleas (Siphonaptera)
		- Ectoparasites of mammals (74%) and birds
		- Most are host-specific, at least one species per mammal species, but no species specific to humans
		- Family Cimicidae - human bedbug, *Cimex lectularis*
			- Piercing mouthparts that feed on blood so the female can reproduce afterwards
	- Moths & butterflies (Lepidoptera)
		![[butterfly mouth.png]]
		- Butterflies consume nectar
		- For moth and butterfly adults, they do not need to bite to feed on nectar so the <u>galea</u> component of the maxillae are modified into sucking mouthparts
		- Labium is still palp-like
		- These are curled at rest → <u>haustellate</u> mouthparts
			- When uncoiled these mouthparts are very long
	- Bees (Hymenoptera)
		![[bee mouth.png]]
		- Also consume nectar 
		-  Still have broad mandibles but the maxillae and labium are greatly elongated
- Elongation of mouthparts forming a <u>proboscis/rostrum</u>
###### Sponging
* Mostly scavengers or parasites
* Labium is extended into a lobe-like sponge called the <u>labellum</u>
* Insect releases saliva onto solid food to liquefy it → labellum absorbs liquid food
* Mostly true flies (Diptera)
- Sponge-like structure for mouths
	![[sponging mouthpart.png]]
	![[spongelike electron micrograph.png]]

#### Eyes and Ocelli
- Visual system of insects mainly dominated by compound eyes but there are 2 other light gathering structures:
	- Ocelli in adults, stemmata in larvae
- Most larval and adult insects have a pair of large compound eyes placed laterally on the head
	- Aside from some insects that live in caves or termites and ant nests
	- Compound eyes are composed of many individual units called <u>ommatidia</u>
	![[compound eye diagram.png]]
	- Eyes can occupy most of the head in some insects such as dragonflies, which have 30,000 ommatidia per eye (e.g. dragonflies)
	- Each <u>ommatidium</u> is a lens system
		- Composed of a transparent cuticular lens overlying a <u>crystalline cone</u> which focuses the light onto 8 elongated retina-like cells (<u>retinula cells</u>)
		- Membranes of these retinula are clustered along the longitudinal axis of the ommatidium, where these clusters are called <u>rhabdomeres</u>
		- Each of these ommatidia are separated by pigment cells, meaning light is fully contained with each lens
		- Little visual overlap between each ommatidium
		- Image seen through compound eyes are a composite of apposed points of lights of different intensities
	- Advantages of compound eyes
		- Flies can register light 10x faster than vertebrates (humans)
	- Disadvantages of compound eyes
		- Compared to the vertebrate eye, insect vision is somewhat blurry with relatively poor resolving power
	- Some insects can see up to 4 pigments, detect patterns of polarised light (assists in navigation) and can detect ultraviolet light
	- <u>Ocelli</u> = come in clusters of 3, less often 2, but are always between the compound eyes and gather light
		- Each ocellus is composed of a lens and retinula cells
		- Thought to be ‘horizon detectors’, controlling roll and pitch during flight

#### Antennae
![[insect antennae.png]]
- Hexapods have a pair of antennae which are movable and segmented
- Primitively possess 8 segments although these segments can be fused or subdivided; some insects have up to 50 segments
	- <u>Scape</u> = basal antennal segment
	- <u>Pedical</u> = next segment after the scape
	- <u>Flagellum</u> = remaining segments
	- Antennae can have laterally oriented projections on each segmented
	- Most specialised and distinctive antennae exist in the advanced flies which have a 3 segmented form, with a thin subdistal <u>arista</u>
- Structures that can pick up pheromones and other chemicals for communication within a species
	- Can be very sensitive, e.g. male moths can detect pheromones from females kilometres away
	- Associated with comb-like antennae

### Thorax
- Concerned with movement, locomotion, flight
- Each of the 3 thoracic segments bears a pair of legs
		![[insect thorax segments.png]]
	- <u>Prothorax</u> = anterior most segment of the thorax, bears the first legs/prolegs/forelegs
	- <u>Mesothorax</u> = middle segment, bears the first pairs of wings & the second pair of legs/midlegs
	- <u>Metathorax</u> = posterior most segment, bears the hind wings & the hind legs
	- <u>Pterothorax</u> = last two segmented collected (ptero = wings), wing-bearing thoracic somites
	- Prefix descriptor of the thoracic segment is applied so that:
		- Prolegs/forelegs and components of the forelegs have the prefix fore, e.g. forecoxae, forefemora
		- Midlegs have the prefix meso, e.g. mesocoxae, mesofemora
		- Hindlegs have the prefix meta, e.g. metacoxae, metafemora
	- Exoskeleton of the thorax is box-like and accomodates both the legs and wings + the enlarged musculature required to move them
		![[grasshopper thorax.png]]
		- Usually heavily sclerotised (hardened)
		- Enlarged cavities on the side of the body that houses the leg
#### Wings
- Insects were the first animals to fly and are the only invertebrates with the ability to fly
	- Flight evolved only once insects, in the group Pterygota
		- Winged insects (Neoptera, wing folding) in the early Carboniferous 
		- The most primitive insects with flight that still exist are mayflies - greatly enlarged forewings and much smaller hindwings
	- Was a major evolutionary adaptation of insects, large reason for their ecological success
	- Wings develop as evaginations (outgrowths) of the cuticle
	- Wings are an adult character
	- Wing bugs are present in larval hemimetabolous (partial metamorphosis) insects
##### Wing Types
![[wing types.png]]
- Dragonflies have two large wings, the hindwing without an anal lobe, complex venation and multiple cross veins
- <u>Tegmina</u> = roaches (Blattodea) have leathery protective forewings and have complex venation but without cross veins
- <u>Hemelytron</u> (pl. hemelytra) = true bugs (Hemiptera) have their forewings divided into a hard proximal part and a soft membraneous distal part
- <u>Elytra</u> = beetles (Coleoptera) have hardened forewings with venation lost, protective cover for hind wings
- Moths’ and butterflies’ forewings with a closed proximal cell with radiating veins
- <u>Haltere</u> = flies (Diptera) hindwings are reduced to a paddle shape
	- Beat at the same frequency as the forewings
	- Act to counterbalance the wings
#### Legs
- Legs to walk, run, hop, jump, capturing/holding food, male-male sexual combat, specialised to collect pollen (honey bees)
- Legs are packed with sensory units
- Almost all insects have 3 pairs of legs
	- Some insects, particularly the larvae, have become greatly specialised, occupying microhabitats where legs are of little use and can thus be secondarily lost
- The leg is divided into six segments
	![[insect leg.png]]
	- <u>Coxa</u> (pl. coxae) = most often cone like, point of articulation with the wall of the thorax, has varying degrees of mobility depending on the insect group
	- <u>Trochanter</u> (pl. trochanters) = articulate the coxa to the femur
	- <u>Femur</u> (pl. femora) = generally small in larval insects, but in most adult insects is the largest and most robust segment of the leg
	- <u>Tibia</u> (pl. tarsi) = divided into 2 5 sub-segments which are called <u>tarsomeres</u> which are freely moveable
	- <u>Pretarsus</u> (pl. pretarsi) = the apical most segment and the smallest
		- In many ways is the most important segment as it is the point of contact between the insect and its environment
		- Composed of a pair of claws
		- <u>Arolium</u> = lobe-like structure between the claws which has a supporting function
##### Insect leg Types
- Femora and tibiae are well developed in all legs
	- <u>Gressorial</u> = walking
	- <u>Cursorial</u> = running
- Hind legs much larger than the prolegs and the middle legs, disproportionally so and often the femora are swollen
	- <u>Saltatorial</u> = jumping
- Tibiae have enlarged spade-like processes with tarsi greatly reduced
	- <u>Fossorial</u> = digging
		- Insects that live in soil, e.g. hemipteran group called burrowing bugs, carab beetles and dung beetles
- Forelegs greatly enlarged and forefemora greatly enlarged often with teeth for grasping prey
	- <u>Raptorial</u> = seizing prey
- Leg types evolve independently in many insect groups
	![[insect legs for digging.png]]
	- Each of the above species have independently evolved the shovel like tibiae (segment in gold) and the tarsi are reduced in the bottom 4 insects - convergence in character states
### Abdomen
![[insect abdomen.png]]
- 11 segments, although the first is often reduced
- <u>Pregenital abdomen</u> = first 7 segments in females and the first 8 segments in males
- <u>Terminalia</u> = segments past the pregenital, house the male and female genitalia
- <u>Ovipositor</u> = in more primitive insects like grasshoppers, the external component of the female genitalia are modified into an egg-laying tube; eggs can be deposited on the ground, on plants or in other organisms
	- Parasitoid wasps can have very long ovipositors
### Reproductive system
- Insects are <u>dioecious</u> = separate sexes
- Most are <u>oviparous</u> = egg laying

#### Male reproductive system - external
![[insect male reproductive system.png]]
- Composed of the 9th abdominal segment which is often produced into a genital capsule, with an opening from which the intromittent organ (penis/aedeagus) is <u>everted</u> (turned outward)
## Internal Anatomy
### Circulatory system
![[insect dorsal vessel.png]]
![[insect circulatory system.png]]
- Open circulatory system, no closed vessels as in vertebrates
- <u>Haemolymph</u> (insect blood) = moves freely around the body organs
- Pattern of blood flow is determined by peristaltic contractions of the longitudinal <u>dorsal vessel</u> (analogous to a heart)
- Longitudinal contractions of the dorsal vessel pumps haemolymph to the head
- Haemolymph/blood does not carry oxygen - transports nutrients, wastes, hormones
### Tracheal system
![[respiration in fleas.png]]
- Gaseous exchange refers to the gain of oxygen and elimination of carbon dioxide
- <u>Tracheal system</u> = gaseous exchange occurs through a network of tubes formed by invagination of the body wall
	- <u>Invagination</u> = infolding of a portion of the outer layer of a blastula in the formation of a gastrula
	- Connects directly to the cells
- Tubes/<u>tracheae</u> open to the surface at <u>spiracles</u>
- Up to 10 pairs of spiracles on pleuron of thorax and abdomen

### Digestive system
![[insect gut cross section.png]]
![[major components of insect guts.png]]
- Insect guts are usually straight, divided into foregut, midgut and hindgut
- Foregut and hindgut lined with cuticle (like the exoskeleton)
- Midgut produces peritrophic membrane
- Faeces often produced as discrete pellets lined with chitinous membrane
### Central Nervous System
- <u>Neurone/nerve cell</u> = basic component of the nervous system
- Nerve cells operate by <u>neurotransmitters</u>
- Cell bodies of neurons are aggregated into nerve centres called <u>ganglia</u>
- The <u>central nervous system</u> runs ventrally in the body cavity
- the CNS is composed of ganglia joined by longitudinal nerve chords called <u>connectives</u>
- Primitively, there are two <u>ganglia</u> per segment
- Most derived insects have the <u>ganglia</u> fused into a single mass
![[cross section of insect somite.png]]
- Each somite is divided into a dorsal <u>tergite</u>, lateral <u>pleuron</u> and the ventral <u>sternite</u>
![[insect nervous system.png]]
- In primitive insects, there are head, thoracic and abdominal ganglia with paired connectives
	- Increasingly, the ganglia became fused so in advanced insects the thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused into the compound ganglia

# Growth & Development
- Insect growth is discontinuous due to their stiff exoskeleton
- Growth occurs through moulting of the exoskeleton
	- Moulting occurs by the secretion of moulting fluid between the epidermis and the cuticle
	- Moulting fluid contains digestive enzymes which break down the cuticle
	- Old cuticle is then shed (<u>ecdysis</u>) and the new body is freed
	- Splitting of the old cuticle follows a typical pattern
			![[splitting of old cuticle.png]]
		- Occurs along the midline of the body typically and the next stadium emerges dorsally from the previous instar
	- Blood is then pumped forward in the body and into the limbs
	- When the body has been unfolded and fully expanded, the new procuticle is sclerotised (hardened)
## Development of Entognatha & Wingless Insects
- Growth indeterminate (they continue to moult until they die)
- Do not continually increase in size when they are adults
- Ametabolous development - larvae resemble adults but lack genitalia
## Development in Winged Insecta (Pterygota)
- Growth determinate (there is a definitive stage where growth & moulting stops)
- Metamorphosis occurs between last larval stage and adult, with marked change in body form
- The final instar of insects with determinate growth is the adult/imago
### Growth Patterns
![[hemimetabolous development.png]]
- <u>Instar/stadium</u> = each larval period
- <u>Stadia/stadium</u> = pupal and adult stages
- <u>Hemimetabolous</u> - egg → 5 larval instars → adult
	![[incomplete metamorphosis growth.png]]
	- Also known as <u>incomplete metamorphosis</u>
	- Larvae are known as <u>nymphs</u>
	- Larvae have similar morphology to adults but lack wings and genitalia
	- Latter larval instars have wing buds = <u>exopterygotes</u>
	- Adult form is reached after 5 moults
	- Hemimetaboly occurs in Mayflies (Ephemeroptera), Dragonflies, Orthopteroid orders, Hemipteroid orders
- <u>Holometabolous</u> - egg → 3/4 larval instar → pupa → adult
	- Also known as <u>complete metamorphosis</u>
	- Larvae with very different morphology to adults (e.g. caterpillars and butterflies)
	- Larvae enter a resting phase called the <u>pupal stage</u>, then emerge as adult
	- Major structural rearrangement in pupal stage occurs to produce an adult
	- Holometabolous insects, referred to as <u>endopterygotes</u> - evidence of wings in larvae present internally called <u>imaginal discs</u>
	- Holometaboly occurs in a natural group called the <u>Holometabola</u>
		- Coleoptera
		- Diptera
		- Hymenoptera
		- Lepidoptera
			- Butterflies have a distinctive pupa, sometimes called a <u>chrysalis</u>
	- Holometaboly evolution has resulted in larvae and adults specialising on different food and microhabitats
	- Larval and adult stages may differ in:
		- Habitat - e.g. freshwater vs terrestrial, soil vs canopy
		- Feeding - e.g. herbivore vs nectar feeding
		- Size - e.g. larvae may be larger than adults
