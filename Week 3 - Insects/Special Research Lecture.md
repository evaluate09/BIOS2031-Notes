# Communication in Invertebrates
- <u>Signal</u> = any aspect of the signaler’s phenotype that conveys information (‘intentionally or not')
## Modes of Communication
- Visual signal (movement, colour, pattern)
- Auditory signal (sound, vibrations)
- Tactile signal (direct contact)
- Chemical signal (volatile, non-volatile)
## Functions of Communication
- Suitability as a mate (mate quality)
	- E.g. peacock dances
	- E.g. sneaker males (giant cuttlefish)
	- E.g. nuptial gift display in dance flies
- Unsuitability as a mate
- Resource-holding potential
- Unpalatability
- Membership in social group
	- Useful information to social group
		- E.g. bees ‘waggle dance’ which signifies where food is by communicating the angle which it needs to fly in relation to the sun and the distance it needs to fly (length of dance)
			- Dances in the direction of the angle, relative to the direction of gravity
			- 1 second = ~750 metres
- Dominance status in social group
- Need for parental care
	- E.g. Nicrophorus carrion beetles
## Case Study: Sexual Interactions in a Carrion Fly
- Sexual selection on male body shape
- Feed on moose carcasses
- Males - elongated heads, longer antennae, longer forelegs
	- Used in male-male combat
		- Males defend sun spots on carcasses, striking each other with elongated heads and antennae and boxing each other with their forelegs
		- Sun spots are chosen because females with immature eggs go there to bask + females only mate once and lay eggs at their carcass 
	- Used in reproduction
		- Waltzing display around a female - holding his antennae up and holding foreleg up
		- If the female is receptive they will touch forelegs, male will somersault onto female’s back and the flies will copulate
	- Trends in sexual selection
		- Shorter antennae / head was better for fighting - atypical head shape for flies 
		- Elongated heads / antennae - better courtship performance, accepted by females sooner and transferred more sperm; perhaps correlated with larger testes and producing more sperm
		- Length is a compromise from conflicting vectors of sexual selection
- After mating in species, female expel seminal fluid and eat it
	- Stimulatory substance presence in the seminal fluid that helps stimulate females to produce and lay eggs - some complex chemical communication in the species; sexual conflict mediated by chemical communication in the seminal fluid
## Current Research
- Neriid flies - similar sexual dimorphism, elongated heads, antennae and legs
	- Elaborate male combat behaviour
- Stick & leaf insects - camouflage
	- Most species, females can reproduce sexually or asexually depending on whether they mate
		- If they don’t mate, unfertilised eggs that develop through pathogenesis and hatch only into daughters
		- Why can’t other animals do this, perhaps sexual conflict may be evolved in limiting the reproductive flexibility in animals?
	- Pheromones are involved in mediating sexual conflict in stick insects
