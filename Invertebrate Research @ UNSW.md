(I’d probably just do the cryopreservation thing tbh)
## Grazer Impacts on Giant Kelps and Seagrass Beds
Poore, AGB, L Gutow, J Pantoja, F Tala, D Jofre Madariaga and M Thiel. 2014. Major consequences of minor damage: impacts of small grazers on fast growing kelps. _Oecologia_ 174: 789. ([link](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00442-013-2795-4))
### Animal used
- Isopod *Amphoroidea typa* on 2 species of large kelps, *Lessonia spicata* and *Macrocystis pyrifera*
- Phylum Arthropoda → Subphylum Crustacea → Class Malacostraca → Order isopoda
### Aim of research topic
- Predict the impact of tissue loss on kelp performance
- Determine the relationship between the observed levels of damage and parameters that contribute to individual fitness for kelp
- Explanation
	- Herbivores usually reduce fitness of the plants they eat
	- Consequences of damage to an individual plant not easily predicted by the amount of tissue consumed or average grazer abundance
	- How growth and photosynthesis of 2 species of fast-growing kelps are affected by localised damage by a grazing isopod
		- Evidence that amphipod grazing is associated with declines in biomass of kelp
### Main findings
#### Disproportionate Impact of Grazing
- Minor grazing damage by a small herbivore can have disproportionately large effects on the growth rate of a highly productive kelp
- Grazing isopods consumed less than 0.5% of *L.spicata* biomass per day but reduced the concentration of pigments by up to 60% and blade growth by almost 80%
- Individual L. spicata can face extensive surface damage due to the spatial aggregation of grazers; damage associated with reduced growth
	- Contrast with the expectation that the adult stages of kelps are rarely impacted by canopy-dwelling mesograzers
- *M.pyrifera* displayed high growth rates unaffected by isopod grazing
- No evidence that the photosynthetic efficiency of blade tissue differed between damaged and undamaged tissue → isopod grazing on the blade growth of *L.spicata* are most likely to result from the large reductions in the concentration of photosynthetic pigments per blade area
	- *M. pyrifera* may be unaffected by isopod damage due to the levels of damage never reaching thresholds that would reduce growth, or because the kelp has a higher potential to compensate for tissue losses due to reallocation of resources
#### Clumped Distribution of Grazers
- The isopod was highly aggregated at the scales of stipes and holdfasts → however decline in blade growth rate with damage in the field was evidence across the entire range of damage levels, and not limited to cases of extreme damage
#### Long Term Effects
- L. spicata → reduced growth and pigment levels from grazing could negatively affect reproduction and long-term fitness, particularly as damage was observed on both old and new tissue near meristems
- Crustacean mesograzers can affect the growth rate of kelps under typical environmental conditions
	- Even low densities of small grazers can negatively affect kelp performance and that their impacts are not simply predicted by the amount of biomass consumed
	- Mesograzers <u>can</u> control the abundance of some marine primary producers

### Why are invertebrates appropriate for addressing those research aims
- Highlights the significant effects of crustacean mesograzer damage on kelp productivity and growth - challenges the assumption that adult kelps are largely unaffected by small grazers
- Isopod and other crustacea herbivores / grazers are abundant in the ocean → the isopod was chosen as it is abundant and is typically found in intertidal and shallow subtidal kelp forests so it would be representative of the true environment where the species and its grazing patterns would be fairly prevalent
- Useful to look out for impactful invertebrates in aquaculture and fisheries
