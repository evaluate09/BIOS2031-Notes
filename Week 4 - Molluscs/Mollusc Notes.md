# Phylum Mollusca 
## Classification
- Molluscs = soft ones
- Large, diverse, ancient, successful phylum
- 2nd largest animal taxon (after arthropods)
	- ~100,000 living species
	- ~35,000 fossil species
### Classes
![[mollusc systematics.png]]
![[general mollusc.png]]
#### Class Monoplacophora
![[monoplacophora.png]]
- small (3mm - 3cm), flattened marine molluscs that inhabit deep water
- Lack torsion
- Eat detritus and sponges
- Show some evidence of serial repetition of parts 
	- 8 pairs of pedal retractor muscles
	- 5-6 pairs of gills, 6 pairs of kidneys
#### Class Aplacophora
![[aplacophora.png]]
- Small, worm-like molluscs (<5mm, but can reach 30cm)
- 300 species
- Deep sea
- Calcareous spicules instead of a shell
	- Mantle forms the body wall which secretes spicules
- Cylindrical body and reduced foot
- Early offshoot from ancestral mollusc
#### Class Scaphopoda
![[scaphopoda.png]]
- Tusk Shells
- 500 species
- Buried in sand at depths from 6-7000m
- Tubular shell, open at both ends so water comes in at the top to oxygenate by water flowing over the gills
- Foot for digging and lay buried face down in the sand
#### Class Polyplacophora - Chitons
##### General Features
![[chitons.png]]
- 800 species, all marine
- Most closely related to the ancient mollusc
- Evidence of segmentation, shell with 8 overlapping plates
- Broad, flat, creeping foot
- Highly adapted for living on rocks, specialised features include:
	- Low body profile
	- Long radula - scraping rock material off rocks
	- Long rectum - process this rock material
	- Subdivided shell allows better mold to rock surface (chitons can curl up) which is advantageous because:
		- Chitons live in intertidal areas which can get hot - folding yourself up lets you get into moist crevices which lets you escape things like heat and wave stress
		- Also gives protection from predators
- Scraping molluscs, browse on microalgae and bacteria on the rocks
- Have not undergone torsion
##### Respiration
![[ventral view of chiton.png]]
- Flow of water → head region → down the inhalant chamber → across the gills in which oxygen is extracted → deoxygenated water passed into exhalant chamber → back of the chiton → out through pores in the rear end
##### Shell
![[chiton dorsal view.png]]
- Retractor muscle underneath each plate which is articulated onto the plates in front of it and behind it - allows animal to roll up into a ball for protection or get into crevices
##### Reproduction
- Separate sexes
- External fertilisation - tide comes in, males and females spawn their eggs and sperm and fertilise in the water column
- Planktonic trochophore larva –> develops into a juvenile chiton
![[chiton larva.png]]
#### Class Gastropoda
- Largest molluscan class ~100,000 species
- All habitats
- The only terrestrial molluscs
- Univalve (one) shell, usuallyy coiled and external (may be reduced or cone like in some species)
- Large creeping foot
- 1-2 ciliated gills
- Typically resemble ancestral molluscs
	- Coiled
	- Torted
	- Asymmetrical
	- Have a well-developed head
##### Subclass Prosobranchia
- Marine snails
- Show torsion
- Single shell, usually spiral
- Head usually bearing tentacles with basal (primitive) eyes
- Large creeping foot
- Often feature <u>operculum</u> = calcareous shell that sits at the edge of the food, foot  can retract and operculum covers the opening to the shell and offers protection
- Gonochoristic - separate sexes
##### Subclass Opisthobranchia
- Sea slugs, sea hares
- 1 auricle, 1 gill, 1 nephridium (left) - lost the organs on the right hand side of their body
- Gills often lost altogether
- <u>Hermaphrodites </u>= male and female
- No operculum
- Detorsion - no longer twisted → Bilaterally symmetrical
![[gills.png]]
	- Gills moved to the back end of the mollusc 
- Reduced shell or absent
- Bright colouration serves as a warning to predators because they contain toxins
	- Toxins lethal to animals (e.g. pets)
##### Subclass Pulmonata
- Terrestrial snails and slugs
- Some intertidal gastropods are also pulmonates
- Molluscs with a lung
- 1 auricle, 1 nephridium, gills absent completely
- Mantle cavity modified into a lung
- Often without shell, detorted, bilaterally symmetrical (slugs)
- Operculum lost (shell lost means no need for operculum)
##### Elongation of the Shell
- Early molluscan shell was a simple low dorsal shield - not a safety retreat
- Gastropoda lengthened the shell into a long cone - a retreat into which the animal could withdraw
![[long shell.png]]
- Shell asymmetry
	- More modern molluscs spiraled the shell to make it more asymmetrical, twisted it so major axis becomes oblique to make the shell stable - but the body is now twisted on the inside
		![[shell shapes.png]]
###### Torsion
- <u>Torsion</u> = visceral mass and shell turn 180 degrees counterclockwise
![[torsion.png]]
- Twists the gut into a “U”
- Twists the nervous system into a figure 8
- Although torsion stabilises the shell and provides a lower center of gravity it comes with a <u>problem</u>: 
	- Mantle cavity is now in the front → openings of gonoducts, kidneys and anus are above the head - <u>sanitation problem</u> 
	- Body is twisted, so mantle cavity is compressed on the right - water flow restricted
		![[torsion consequence.png]]
- Early gastropods solution to the sanitation problem:
	- Add <u>opening</u> in the shell for the exhalent current
	- Water flows into the mantle cavity → out through the opening
	- Both ctenidia (gills) still present
	- Abalone (paua), slit snails, keyhole limpets
			![[pores.png]]
		- (E.g. abalone water flow)
		- A series of <u>pores</u> above the mantle cavity
		- Water enters over the head → flows over the 2 gills → over the anus and nephridiopores → out through the shell openings
- Higher gastropods solution to the sanitation problem:
		![[higher gastro sanitation.png]]
	- Right gill, right nephridium and right atrium are lost
	- Anus is displaced to the right
	- Water enters the left side of the mantle cavity
	- Flows over the left gill, then over the left nephridiopore and anus, then out the right side
##### Digestive System
![[gastropod digestion.png]]
- Food enters through buccal apparatus → oesophagus → stomach → rectum → anus
	- Transported through the system by cilia and not by muscles
	- Extracellular digestion occurs in the stomach which secretes salivary glands
	- Intracellular digestion and absorption occurs in the digestive gland
##### Nervous System
![[gastropod cns.png]]
- Gastropod brain is a pair of cerebral ganglia on top of the pharynx and are connected by 2 nerve chords connected to the buccal ganglia which control the radula movement
- 2 pleural ganglia supply the mantle and main retractor muscle
- 2 pedal ganglia coordinate musculature of the foot and locomotion
- 2 visceral ganglia serve other parts of the body (e.g. guts, heart, etc.)
###### Sensory Organs
- Eyes
	- Range from simple pigment cups to sophisticated eyes with a lens
	- Responsive to light intensity rather than being image forming like eyes or arthropods - some have lenses and may form basic images
- Tentacles
	- Tactile and chemoreceptive, may have eyes (terrestrial species)
- <u>Statocysts</u> = organs that help molluscs orientate themselves so they can tell whether they’re up or down - located near the foot, near the pedal ganglia
- <u>Osphradium</u> = on or close to the gill in mantle cavity, tests the incoming water
	- Well-developed in scavengers and must locate food by waterborne chemicals
	- Found in species with siphons at the end, including bivalves so they can test the incoming water for its suitability of consumption
##### Reproductive System
- Early gastropods: mostly separate sexes, external fertilisation
- Derived gastropods:
	- <u>Hermaphrodites</u> (both male & female), internal fertilisation
	- Behaviour patterns are more complicated to do with mating
- Hermaphrodites:
	- <u>Simultaneous</u> (both male and female parts at the same time) vs consecutive (male first → switch to female, vice versa)
	- Pulmonata and Opisthobranchia are simultaneous hermaphrodites
		- Courtship ritual then exchange sperm with each other
	- Slipper snails (prosobranchs) are <u>protandric</u> = develop initially as males and a proportion of the population will become female as they age
- <u>Helix</u>
	![[gastropod reproductive system.png]]
	- Calcareous dart sac driven into the other animal its mating
	- Penis extensible and delivers sperm which is stored in the copulatory bursa
	- Eggs in soil which hatch as juveniles
	- No trochophore or veliger stage
##### Gastropod Larvae
- Archaeogastropoda - planktonic trochophore larva (more ancient prosobranch species) e.g. abalone
- Most other - more derived veliger larva which develops from the trochophore larva
	![[gastropod trochophore.png]]
	- Swim using a ciliated velum
	- Has a shell
	- Undergo torsion before settling on the water column to uptake a benthic lifestyle
- Pulmonata
	- <u>Direct development</u> = little snails develop in the eggs and hatch out and crawl out as juvenile larvae
		- Land snails don’t have trochophore or veliger stage because they’re dispersal stages which have no use in a terrestrial setting
#### Class Bivalvia - clams, oysters, scallops
- Diverse, large, derived group
- ~9000 living species
- Originally in soft marine sediment, now in almost all aquatic habitats
- Important
	- Ecologically - Large habitat forming species, oyster reefs form entire ecosystems
	- Economically - aquaculture , 100,00 tonnes of Perna caliculus per year
	- Global pests 
		- Zebra mussel , settles on infrastructure can completely immobilise water vessels, can enclose water intake pipes
		- Pacific oyster originally from the south east Asian area - useful in aquaculture
##### Living Mode
###### Soft Bottom Burrowers
- Common/ancestral form
- Mantle margins often fused to seal out sediment and irritants (e.g. sand)
- Blade like foot modified for digging into soft sediment
- Long siphons - length dictated by the depth at which clams bury to
- Burrowing clam feet
![[burrowing clam feet.png]]
	- Clams elongate their foot and penetrate it into the sediment
	- Make a bowl/anchor so the foot cannot be pulled back up into the shell
	- Retract the foot so the shell is pulled towards the anchor
	- Repeat the process to burrow even further
##### Attached epifauna
![[attached bivalves.png]]
- Reduced foot, byssus, tapered shell
	- Tapered shell helps them sit on sediment surface and persist in clumps
	- Attached to surface by byssus filaments, produced by byssus gland
		- For mussels, the byssus attachment is not necessarily permanent - can attach and un-attach to surfaces to find better places to live
		- Byssus threads can also be used in defense, attach to dog whelk so they can’t get onto them and predate them
##### Unattached epifaunta
- Live on the surface without attaching to the substrate
- Some are mobile and swim by clapping the valves together, e.g. scallops
##### Borers
![[bivalve borers.png]]
- In wood, rock, coral
- Shell valves converted into sharp tooth-like boring structures
- <u>Shipworm</u> = wood-boring bivalve that causes significant damage to docks, pilings and ship planks
##### General Features
- Shell in 2 parts, hinged dorsally and closed by 2 adductor muscles - this can change depending on species
- Head reduced but foot well developed for burrowing
- Predominantly sedentary
	- Attached e.g. oyster
	- Burrowing e.g. Pipis
- Large gills used in feeding and gas exchange, lack radulae
- Clams, oysters, mussels, scallops

##### Bivalve Shell
![[bivalve shell.png]]
- 2 lateral valves joined by a dorsal hinge
- Hinge ligament = pad of elastic protein which helps the bivalve shells open and close
- Hinge flanked by umbos - protect the hinge and the hinge ligament from wear and tear
- Hinge teeth prevent sheer of valves past each other
	- ![[bivalve sheer.png]]
	- Lock and key system - raised area on bottom and groove on top
		- Shutting the valve means the raised area fits into the groove - prevents the two shells from twisting against each other when closed
- Adductor muscles close the valves
	- Originally 2 (dorsal and anterior adductor muscle), seen below on the sides
		![[adductor muscles.png]]
	- One can be reduced, second becomes central
		- E.g. in scallops, the muscle is what we eat
		![[hinge ligament bivalve.png]]
	- Hinge ligament antagonises / does the opposite of what the adductor muscles do
	- Shell open: adductor muscles relaxed (stretched out), hinge ligament is contracted and pulls the shells together
	- Shell close: adductor muscles contract to hold the shell closed, hinge ligament relaxes
##### Bivalve Mantle
- Underlies the shell valves
- Encloses a spacious mantle cavity
- Ciliated, highly vascularised, adds in gas exchange
- Each mantle edge has 3 folds
- Outer fold of the mantle is what secrets the shell
- Middle fold of the mantle is sensory, often with eyes, chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors
	![[scallop eyes.png]]
- Inner fold of the mantle is muscular - mantle muscles attach the mantle to the valve along the pallial line
	![[inner fold.png]]
	- Pallial line = dark line on the inside of the shell
##### Mantle Siphons
- Posterior mantle edge is modified to form two tubular siphons
- Water flow is generated by gill cilia
	- Inhalant siphon brings water into the ventral mantle chamber
		- Generally inhalant siphons are larger
	- Exhalant siphon removes water from the dorsal mantle chamber
![[mantle siphons.png]]
###### Ventilation in Bivalves
![[ventilation in bivalves.png]]
- Water comes in through the inhalant siphon → ventral cavity → wash across the gill → gills remove oxygen in water and transport around the body → deoxygenated water is transported into dorsal ventral cavity → exhalant siphon
##### Feeding & Digestion
- Food string pulled in by cilia → gills → crystalline style → mouth with labial palps 
	- <u>Labial palps</u> = pre-sorting, anything worth eating is digested in the stomach
- Digestion - extracellularly in the stomach, intracellularly in the digestive gland
![[bivalve digestion.png]]
##### Nervous System
- No torsion = bilaterally symmetrical
![[bivalve cns.png]]
##### Reproduction
- Mostly separate sexes
- Gonads in visceral mass around gut (spill out around the gut, similar to if you eat too much then the fat grows everywhere)
- External fertilisation in water or in mantle cavity
	- Eggs generally orange because they contain carotene, sperm white
- Trochophore (24-48 hours) followed by veliger (~2 weeks, depends on water temperatures)
![[bivalve stages.png]]
##### Life Cycle - Giant Clam
![[giant clam life cycle.png]]
- Consecutive hermaphrodites: start as a male → develop female body parts
	- Spawn the sperm first before spawn their eggs to stop them self-fertilising
	- Veliger develops a foot → Pediveliger  → drops out of the water column into a sediment surface → metamorphosis into a juvenile
#### Class Cephalopoda - squid, cuttlefish, octopus
- Very <u>derived</u> = possessing features believed to be more advanced or improved than those other organisms
- Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, ammonites
- 600 extant species, 7000 fossil species
- Largest invertebrates and active predators
##### General features
- Shell reduced and internalised or lost
	- Retained in Nautilus - primitive/old cephalopod
- Head well developed with tentacles, eyes and large brain
- Mantle is large and muscular and envelops the body and visceral hump
- Foot is reduced and forms part of funnel and arms
###### Extreme Adaptations
- Vampire squid
	- Small, black, whitee jaws, red eyes
	- Hangs motionless in the water column
	- Lives in the oxygen deprived layers (600-800m depth) throughout the world’s temperate and tropical oceans
	- Hemocyanin binds oxygen extremely effectively, very low metabolic rate, relatively high gill surface areas
##### Subclass Nautiloidea - nautilus
- Last living cephalopod with external shell
	- 6 living species, many fossils
	- Around for 500 million years
	- Primitive eyes, no ink sac or chromatophores
	- Evolved before there were fish in the ocean
- Not as active, intelligent and responsive as other cephalopods
- Basically swimming snails
![[nautilus.png]]
- Slow moving, clumsy organism
	- Gas pumped into gas chambers connected by siphuncle
		- If the nautilus wants to go up in the water column it pumps more gas into the chambers, if it wants to reduce the gas then it takes gas out of the chambers
##### Subclass Ammonoidea - ammonites
- All extinct 65 million years ago along with the dinosaurs
- Most widely recognised non-dinosaur fossils
- External coiled shell
- Shell sutures intricately convoluted
- Capable of moving up and down the water column
##### Subclass Coleoidea
- Best known and most diverse cephalapods
- ~600 living species
- Squid, cuttlefish, octopus
- Shell reduced or absent; internal if present
- 10 or 8 arms (depends on Decapoda/Octopoda)
- Economically important
###### Order Decapoda - squid, cuttlefish, belemnites
- Belemnites are all extinct
- Cuttlefish shells are internal but bones are still used for buoyancy control
		![[cuttlefish shells.png]]
###### Order Octopoda - octopus
- No shells - living mode need to fit into tight spaces
- Characteristic molluscan foot, head, visceral mass, funnel and mantle cavity
##### Feeding
- Fast, active predators
- Well developed sense organs and nervous systems
- Hunt actively, capture food with suckered tentacles
- Poison glands sometimes present
- Stun/kill their prey with toxic saliva, carry it to the mouth with the tentacles, tear the pieces off with strong parrot-like beak and radula
- Squids are pelagic carnivores
	- Surface/midwater hunters
	- Some species like giant squid have giant hooks instead of suckers, can swivel up to 360 degrees
	- Torpedo like shape, fast
	![[squid.png]]
- Cuttlefish stalk benthic prey, go slowly across the benthos
- Octopus are benthic predators - look for macroinvertebrates to eat along the benthos
	- They line dens (small holes and crevices) from the molluscs they eat 
##### Locomotion
- Mantle cavity has muscular walls
- Contraction of muscles forces a jet of water out through the funnel
- Muscles or elastic recoil of mantle connective tissue refill mantle cavity
- System of valves keep the water flow unidirectional
	- Mantle relaxes → opens up and pulls in through the inhalant siphon → water comes in and mantle is full → valve that shuts off water flow so it cant get back out the inhalant siphon → mantle cavity will contract and force the water out through the exhalant siphon → close the valve on the exhalant siphon so it can bring water in through the inhalant siphon
##### Respiratory System
- Ventilation & gas exchange
- 2 gills (ctenidia) in the mantle cavity
- The swimming current is also the respiratory current
- The current is generated by muscles, not cilia unlike other molluscs
##### Digestive System
![[squid digestive system.png]]
- Food is transported through the gut via muscular peristalsis (similar to humans, most mollusc use cilia)
- Digestion is extracellular in stomach
- Absorption occurs in the digestive caecum
##### Blood Vascular System
- Closed BVS unlike other molluscs
- Capillaries, arteries, veins
	- Need to support high blood pressure to support high metabolic rates because they are very active predators
- Respiratory pigment is hemocyanin
- 3 hearts
	- Median systemic heart
		- Accepts oxygenated blood from the gills → pumps oxygenated blood out to the tissues and the body → as the blood goes out to the tissue = drop in blood pressure so all oxygenated blood is then returned to the branchial heart 
	- 2 branchial (respiratory) hearts
		- In order to bring the blood up to the heart and through the gill → increases the blood pressure to push the blood back up into the gills to get reoxygenated where it then goes through the median heart again
	![[cephalopod heart.png]]

##### Sensory Organs
- Centralised in the head
- Eyes are like vertebrate eyes
	- Cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina
- Statocysts embedded in the chondroid cranium (brain region) - spatial orientation
- Chemoreceptors (olfactory crests) near the eyes - sample water
- Arms and tentacles have tactile and chemoreceptors
- Nautilus have osphradia = highly sensitive chemical receptors
###### Neurosensory system
- Cephalopods have the most advanced neurosensory systems of all the invertebrates
- Development driven by:
	- Predators - need good sensory information
	- Tentacles - very wide range of capability require a large brain for control
	- Highly active requiring good coordination of mantle, funnel and arms
	- Colour change - needs good information on background and extensive nerve control to coordinate colour changes
![[octopus brain.png]]
- Very large optic lobes and brachial nerves to arms in comparison to other molluscs
###### Eyes
![[octopus eye.png]]
- Camera like image with high resolution
- Lens moves back and forth which keeps the eye in focus - similar in fishes
- Optic nerves at the back

##### Communication
- Communication through colour
	- E.g. blue-ringed octopus shines bright blue when its threatened or thinks its dangerous
	- Colouration associated with courting
		- Cuttlefish in the middle (male) has half, half colours
		- Colour on the left is a courting colouration, displaying to female on left
		- Right hand side has a swimming along colouration, displayed to the male on the right
		![[cuttlefish colour.png]]

##### Reproduction
- Mating is accompanied by elaborate courtship
- Sexual dimorphism - males and females are morphologically different / different body sizes
![[male cepholapod.png]]
- Single testes and long coil vas deferens which carry sperm to a seminal vesicle → packed into spermatophores → after courtship mating occurs which involves male transferring spermatophore into the female’s mantle with the hectocotylus arm
![[female cephalopod.png]]
- Single ovary at the posterior end of the body, spermatophores are deposited close to the oviducal opening → eggs emerging from the oviduct receive a capsule secreted by the oviducal gland which hardens upon exposure to sea water
##### Development
- Large yolky eggs
- Few eggs, parental care (brooding)
- <u>Direct development</u>, no larva → juveniles develop in eggs and burst out and crawl away
## Evolution & Ancestry
- Adaptive radiation - evolution of many types from a single ancestor
- Ancestral mollusc - limpet like
![[mollusc ancestor.png]]
- Segmented ancestry
	- 8 plates in chitons
	- 3-8 muscle scars on Monoplacophora shell, no longer have plates
	- Multiple ctenidia (gills)
- The shown groups (e.g. chitons, bivalves) are considered too specialised to be a primitive mollusc - evolutionary dead ends
- Flatworms → Molluscs
	![[flatworms to molluscs.png]]
	- Body is now too thick, so specialised organs for respiration and circulation are needed (ctenidia + heart)
	- Foot stays similar to flatworms
	- Added more advanced head with radula
	- Gut and reproductive organs bulge upward - visceral mass
		- Very soft → protected by shell
	- Mantle cavity where gills are housed
## Characteristics
### 3 body parts
#### Head 
- Involved for movement, perception, feeding
- The head is poorly differentiated from the rest of the body, except for gastropods and cephalopods (squid, octopus)
#### Ventral (front) Foot 
![[mollusc feet.png]]
- Primary locomotive part of the body for most molluscs
- Burrowing, surface creeping, attachment to surfaces
- Some classes have retained the flat creeping foot (Amphineura, Monoplacophora, Gastropoda), for digging (Bivalvia, Scaphopoda), fast locomotory processes (Cephalopoda)
#### Dorsal (back) visceral mass (internal organs)
- Used for digestion, circulation, excretion, reproduction
### Mantle
- Secretes shell and mucus
- Part of the mantle overhangs the rest of the body forming the <u>mantle cavity</u> which is open to the environment
	- Aquatic & marine molluscs - mantle cavity is the exit point for fecal and kidney waste and also contains ctenidia and gills
### Buccal mass - mouth
- <u>Radula</u> - rasping tongue, ribbon-like structure composed of many small chitinous (tough and abrasive) teeth 
	- Type of radula depends on what they feed on, hard material is lots of small teeth, soft material is large teeth
- Odontophore - supports and helps the radula move back and forth on surfaces to collect food particles
- Buccal mass is absent in bivalves, most are filter feeders
	- In this case, ctenidia/gills are used for both respiring and feeding
#### Scraping Mollusc
![[mollusc feeding.png]]
- Radula = tooth belt secreted by the buccal sac, pushed out of the map by the odontophore (radula is attached to this)
- Dragged rhythmically along the substrate taking in food particles with a rasping/filing action
- As teeth wear away, they are replaced by the buccal sac
- Movement of radula is aided by retractor and protractor muscles
- <u>Home scars/bioerosion</u> in rocks can occur due to scraping molluscs
	![[homing scars.png]]

#### Modified Radula
- Predatory radula
- Cone shells, have one radular tooth at a time as a poison barb to shoot at prey
- Oyster drills have a radula on a proboscis, acid and fine teeth to bore a hole in prey (e.g. bivalves) and insert proboscis to feed on tissue

### “Open” Circulatory System
![[open mollusc system.png]]
- Except Cephalopoda
- Coelom (fluid-filled cavity that helps protect the cavity and protect cavity from stress) reduced and haemocoel instead is main body cavity which contains the blood
- Open blood system 
- Oxygen supplied directly to organs
- Haemolymph circulates through the <u>body sinuses/haemocoel</u> and bathes the organs directly to supply them
- Oxygenated water passes across the gills → pumped into the heart (housed in reduced coelom) → ventricle component of the heart al the oxygenated haemolymph into the haemocoel (dotted area) - circulates / sloshes around the organs
- 2 auricles = part of the heart that brings oxygenated blood into the body from the gills
- 1 ventricle = pumps blood anteriorly through aorta, brings oxygenated blood into the body 
### 2 Distinct Larval Stages
![[mollusc larvae.png]]
- Trochophore (first) stage and veliger stage
	- Some species can have one or both stages missing
- Both stages have distinct organs that define them
	- Trochophore stage: ciliated band of hairs around the middle that helps in movement and capturing food particles that are transported to the mouth
	- Veliger stage: Veliger (the grey thing with hairs) important for capturing food particles and for swimming and maintaining position in the water column
### Mollusc Shell
![[mollusc shell.png]]
- All components secreted by the mantle (sits on the inside of the shell)
	- <u>Periostracum</u> = lost as bivalves age because it abrades as it rubs up against the environment
	- <u>Prismatic layer</u>
	- <u>Nacreous layer </u>= shiny layer on the inside, pearly
		- Substances can get in between the mantle and the shell
		- Upon detecting the foreign body it lays down some nacre around the object to isolate it so it doesn’t irritate it anymore - this is how pearls are made
### Other Characteristics
- Non-segmented
- Protostomes = first opening (blastophore) becomes the mouth before anus during embryonic development
