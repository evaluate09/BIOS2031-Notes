## Introduction
- Develop and apply cryopreservation to support coral reef restoration and coral research
- Dr Jonathan Daly from Taronga Zoo
- Reef restoration and adaptation program - range of intervention to mitigate damage occurring on the Great Barrier Reef
- Coral reefs are one of the most important and diverse ecosystems on the planet:
	- Habitat for a quarter of all marine fish species
	- Natural storm barrier that protect coast lines from storm damage
	- Support millions of people around the world by providing food and employment
	- Contribute billions of dollars annually to the global economy
## Coral bleaching:
- Coral reefs made up of individual coral colonies, each coral colony is made up individual genetically identical polyp, each polyp is an individual animal
- Mouth surrounded by tentacle to help it feed + gonads to produce sperm and eggs
- Colour comes from symbiotic Dinoflagellate algae that live in the Gastrodermal cells  
	- Symbionts produce energy by sunlight via photosynthesis - provide coral with up to 90% of their energy requirements
	- Photosynthesis takes place within the chloroplast but when temperature / light intensity rises , damage occurs to photosystem because there is too much energy → all the extra energy is turned into reactive oxygen molecules that damage the symbiont and the coral cells
		- The coral spits out the symbionts due to the stress (<u>symbiont ejection</u>) → coral dies due to not being able to get its energy
- Many bleaching events, including Great Barrier Reef mass bleaching 2016/17 - northern region (2016) , central region (2017), southern region (2020)
- Coral bleaching is a recent phenomenon and are happening more often- 3/4 of all coral reefs will experience annual bleaching in the coming decades
### How to save coral reefs
- Reduce climate change - even if we cut carbon emissions now it would still be too late to avoid major damage to coral reefs
- Reef restoration and research
	- Nurseries and out-planting
		- - E.g. coral trees / frames to grow coral fragments to create new reefs
	- Increased recruitment
		- Increasing larval settlement or planting larval recruits in reefs
	- Assisted evolution
		- Phenotypes and genotypes resistant to warming
	- Reduced solar radiation
		- Cloud brightening to reduce solar radiation
	- Cryopreservation and biorepositories 
		- Secure genetic diversity while diverse populations still exist
## Cryopreservation
- Process of preserving cells and tissues at very low temperatures - liquid nitrogen
- Frozen but alive in liquid nitrogen indefinitely
- Animals cells contain water → forms ice crystal → expands in volume → freezing can cause cells to burst
	- Important to control the freezing process
		- By adding cryoprotectants that dehydrate the cells 
		- Cooling rate
		- Warming rate during thawing
- Types of freezing
	- Slow-cooling - low concentrations of cryoprotectants and slow cooling rates to prevent ice crystals from forming
	- Vitrification - high concentrations of cryoprotectants, rapid cooling rates to form glassy solid without any ice crystals
### Securing Genetic Diversity
#### Coral sperm - <u>advanced</u>
- Main sample type that is targeted, has been cryopreserved for the past 10 years
- Cryopreserved sperm samples stored in banks
- Preservation work flow:
	![[workflow.png]]
	1. Collect and assess the gametes
	2. Computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) - estimate motile concentrate for quality assessment
	3. Sperm mixed with 10% DMSO, cryopreserve samples that are greater than 10<sup>9</sup> cells per million, expect to lose half of that during cryopreservation
	4. Samples cooled and transferred into liquid nitrogen , samples usually stored in dry shippers that are then sent for secure storage in biorepositories
	5. Information and data goes into database from post thaw quality assessment

##### Sperm assisting in reef restoration
- How does cryopreserved sperm assist with reef restoration?
- Assisted gene flow 
- Took sperm from endangered coral species → used sperm to fertilise fresh eggs collected during spawning → generate larvae and currently hundreds of coral recruits that are being grown 
- Cryopreservation can be used to facilitate genetic flow between isolated populations to help bolster genetic diversity, can be done using samples collected years apart (no moving colonies which would risk disease transmission)

#### Coral larvae - under development
- Harder to cryopreserve
	- Large volume 
	- Multicellular with structural complexity - issues with dehydration
	- Coral tissue are chill sensitive , tissues degrade when exposed to low temperatures→ slow cooling methods used for sperm are not effective
- Advantages of using coral larvae
	- More flexibility with using cryopreserved material - currently not possible to cryopreserve eggs → need to wait for spawning to use sperm
	- Could use material throughout the year without having to wait for eggs to be available
- Overcoming challenges
	- Need more advanced technology
	- Higher concentration cryoprotection with gold particles to vitrify larvae → cryopreserve hundreds of larvae
	- Infrared laser to warm the larvae - recovery rate of 50%, can function normally post thaw and take on symbionts

##### How vitrification & laser warming works
1. Expose coral larvae to vitrification solution containing gold nanoparticles, 1 to 2 micrometre droplet containing the larvae on a cryotop
2. Cryotop loaded into the arm of the cryojig
3. Uses servo motor and programmed controller box to manipulate sample → lower sample directly into liquid nitrogen to vitrify it
4. Raise the sample and simultaneously fire the laser which warms the sample at millions of degrees per minute
- High-throughput processes to increase the number of larvae you can cryopreserve - instead of cryotops you can cryopreserve larvae in droplets (prototype)

#### Coral adult tissues - preliminary stages
- Samples are a lot more challenging than sperm and larvae due to complexity
- Contain symbionts, have a skeleton and contain a lot of water
![[adult coral cryo.png]]
- Microfragments → propagating coral 
	- Coral can reproduce asexually, 1 microfragment can grow and spread out to form a colony
	- Form nanofragments
	
#### Coral symbionts
- Challenging to cryopreserve but important target
- Tough outer membrane that acts a barrier to water and cryoprotectant movement
![[symbiont cryo.png]]
- 2 broad groups of symbionts
	- Symbionts extracted from coral tissues and contain multiple species of symbionts
		- Preserve these ones so we aren’t losing diversity in bleaching events
	- Cultured symbionts that are specific strains  - have not typically worked well with in hospit symbionts extracted from tissues
### Cryopreservation Benefits
- Maintain stock centers for research animals - all research lines it becomes expensive to maintain a lot of phenotypes and genotypes in living culture → cryopreservation is storage of some of those lines in biodiversity, particularly those used less often and then use as required
- Insurance policy so you have a backup in case anything goes wrong
- Secure diversity of symbionts currently on the reef and at risk anytime there is a bleaching event
##### Repository development
- Necessary to actually use the material you are cryopreserving
- Create functional biorepositories for genetic material
- Develop databases to track information
- Aim to create global network of biorepositories for coral - focused initially on sperm and then bringing in other sample types as technologies develop
- Database development, standard set of parameters collected and documented for all samples to help with collaboration and tracking
- Current locations: Taronga cryodiversity brank in Australia, USDA in the US
#### Where it can be used
- Cryopreservation is an enabling technology
![[thing cryo.png]]
- Genetic management
	- Being able to use sperm from a colony across multiple nights or different seasons to ensure you have access to sperm and eggs for specific crosses at the time
- Research support
	- Larval cryopreservation - larvae available outside of spawning 
- Biodiversity
	- Insurance policy against the loss of populations and diversity
	- Optimise strategies available to reef managers to support natural recovery rates 
- All of the above support adaptation research and aquaculture production of corals
#### Challenges
- Limited time frame to secure genetic material from healthy reefs
	- Be practical in development of cryopreservation strategies
	- Research, refinement, upscaling and application of technologies currently
	- Emphasis on cryo technologies that are scalable
	- Work with end-users including other scientists and other reef managers and traditional owners to develop pathways for cryopreserved material and ensure those groups can use those samples that are cryopreserved
	- Share technologies to enable cryopreservation on reefs globally
