## Sponges - Phylum Porifera

### Defining characteristics
- Most primitive multicellular animals, well established in Cambrian (550 MYA) + reef builders in the Devonian (370 MYA)
- Adults are sessile suspension feeders
	- Sessile = permanently attached or established
	- Suspension feeders = an animal that feeds on material (such as planktonic organisms) suspended in water and that usually has various structural modifications for straining out its food
- Metazoans without true tissue
	- Tissue = an aggregation of similar cells that perform a specific function
- <u>Totipotent cells</u> = (of a stem cell) capable of giving rise to any cell type or a complete embryo
- <u>Choanocytes</u> (collar cells) = collar of microvilli (0.1 micrometres apart)
	- Catches bacteria (106 per mL and tiny phytoplankton)
	- Flagellates of choanocytes maintain current, moving water and food particles into the sponge
	![[collar cell.png]]

- <u>Ostia</u> = small holes that cover the entire animal, allows water and desired nutrition to flow inside
- <u>Oscula</u> = larger holes where water flows out
- Layers
	- Pinacoderm = outer layer
	- Choanoderm = inner layer
	- <u>Mesohyl</u> = central layer, between pinacoderm and choanoderm
		- Jelly-like matrix with cells and non-cellular material
			- Fibres (e.g. spongin), spicules and polymers
			- Secretory cells → produces spicules and fibres
			- <u>Archaeocytes/amoebocytes</u> = mobile cells involved in digestion, can change into other cell type
		- Role in digestion, gamete production, skeletal formation and waste secretion
		- Sponge regeneration
		- Morphology is very plastic, i.e., changes in shape with environmental variation

- Cell layers lack a basal membrane
	- <u>Basal membrane</u> = extracellular matrix that lines cells and forms supporting structures
- Skeletal elements of spicules and/or protein fibres
	- <u>Spicule</u> = minute sharp = pointed structures that are present in large numbers
	- <u>Spicule morphology</u> - typically we use spicules to tell sponges apart
	- Made up of calcite or silica in most sponges
	- Act to preserve shape rather than anchor muscles
#### Structural classes
- Based on complexity, not related to taxonomic classes
- <u>Asconoid</u> = tube shaped
- <u>Syconoid</u> = tube with thick body wall
	- Folded body wall
	- Choanocytes grouped in flagellated chambers
	- Greater surface area of choanocytes than asconoid of same size
- <u>Leuconoid</u> = branched network body construction
	- More cells in thicker body wall
	- More flagellated chambers
	- Even greater surface area of choanocytes
- <u>Complex leuconoid spong</u>e = no shape restrictions
	- Complex system of water channels to supply internal chambers
	- Surface area of choanocytes supports massive body

### Class Calcarea (calcareous sponges)
- Mesohyl contains calcium carbonate spicules (skeleton)
- Exclusively marine
- May have asconoid, syconoid or leuconoid body constructions

### Class Hexactinellida (glass sponges)
- Skeleton of six-rayed siliceous spicules
- Exclusively marine
- Usually syconoid

### Class Demospongiae
- Skeleton of siliceous spicules (not six-rayed), spongin fibres or both
	- Collagen-based spongin
- If spicules present they are usually of two types:
	- Small spicules embedded in the “tissues”
	- Large spicules which make up the main skeletal framework
- Can be found in freshwater and marine environments
- Leuconoid body form
- Contains most sponge species

### Life cycle

- Asexual reproduction
	- <u>Fragmentation</u> = an organism is split into fragments upon maturation and the spilled part becomes the new individual
	- <u>Budding</u> = a new organism develops from a bud of an existing organism
	- <u>Gemmules</u> = tough-coated dormant cluster of embryonic cells produced by a freshwater sponge for development in more favourable conditions

#### Sexual reproduction
- Most hermaphroditic (both genders)
- Sperm arise from choanocytes, shed into osculum (where water is expelled)
- Eggs arise from choanocytes/archaeocytes (retained?)
- Male & female gametes develop at different times to avoid self fertilisation

#### Development
- Zygote develops into ciliated larvae
- Most incubate larvae within parent
- Larva settles and develops into adult sponge

#### Feeding
- Filter feeding
- Mobile archaeocytes and choanocytes capture particles (2-5 micrometres)
	- Bacteria, protists, unicellular algae, detritus (waste or debris of any kind)
	- Some sponges are carnivorous, some can take up dissolved organic matter
- Catch, digest and excrete waste products within cells, not within body cavities

#### Sensory systems

- No nervous system, but can respond to environmental cues
- Contractile cells can constrict ostia after disturbance
- Independent effectors with slow response time (insensitive to electrical stimuli)

### Interactions with organisms
- Interactions with macroorganisms
	- Complex morphology offers habitats for eg. brittlestars and shrimp
	- Predation:
		- Specialists: nudibranchs, hawksbill turtles
		- Generalists: urchins, some fish
- Interactions with microorganisms
	- Dense microbial communities (up to 1010 cells per cm3 or 40% of total biomass )
	- Microbes can live intracellularly, in mesohyl or channels
	- Microbial symbionts carry out essential functions for the sponge, such as:
		- CO2 fixation by photosymbionts
		- Uptake of DOM by bacteria
		- Production of vitamins by bacteria
- Chemical defences
	- Sessile animals need form of defence
	- Production of secondary metabolites
		- Metabolite = substance formed in/necessary for metabolism
		- 200 new metabolites reported each year
		- Production is by sponge or microbial associates
		- Many metabolites have antagonistic properties
### Examples
- Cliona species (Boring sponge) = they bore into the calcareous shells of molluscs and limestones
	- Cause bioerosion
	- Specialised archaeocytes called etching cells affect the excavation of calcium carbonate substrates by partial chemical dissolution
- Use of spongin skeleton - cleaning & painting
	- Sponges may have a greater role in coupling planktonic & benthic nutrient flow than assumed
		- Planktonic = to do with plankton
		- Benthic = relating to, or occurring at the bottom of a body of water

- Primal production based on photosynthesis → particulate and dissolved organic carbons
- Dissolved organic carbon is mostly taken up by free living microorganisms that then channel this carbon to higher trophic levels
- Under certain circumstances sponges may have a much greater contribution to this process → taking up dissolved organic matter partially through their own microbes and funnelling that to higher organisms either via direct predation or sponges shedding their choanocytes during their life → forms detritus that is then consumed by higher trophic levels
